			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been exploring various What I Use posts coming across the feed, and I found <a href="https://defaults.rknight.me/">this site</a> that started the prompt and collects a lot of the entries at their site. I haven&rsquo;t listened to the podcast that kicked it off (also at the link), but I like the idea and want to start cataloging that my list too.</p>
<p>There was a brief moment where I learned about new tools everyday, and tried to <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/tools/">catalog them here</a>. But this table is where I am at in late 2025. Many entries in the below table make me think &ldquo;this deserves a full write-up&rdquo;, while others make me think &ldquo;I am starting to hate this, I wonder if there are alternatives. A worthwhile exercise to revisit next year. Gift links are marked with an emoji.</p>

			 <p>Every fan has their idiosyncrasies, especially sports fans. We are all unique little flowers, some vibrant and full of joy, some <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/08/13/lol-lmao-even-espn-sports/">woeful</a> yet resilient. Every one has their little habit and routine (even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mlb/comments/1mpttnx/whats_a_players_iconic_move_or_routine_habit_that/">the players</a>), which makes me certain I am not the only jersey hipster.</p>
<p>What is a jersey hipster, you ask? Well, when you get a sports jersey, there is generally a player&rsquo;s name and number on it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> A fairweather fan can pick the most popular jersey; there will be a lot of them in the team shop after all. But true sickos understand the future value of <a href="https://defector.com/category/lets-remember-some-guys">remembering some guys</a>, and look for a contrarian jersey pick, down the depth chart. This is the jersey hipster.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use my &ldquo;woeful&rdquo; teams from the link above as an example. Would I enjoy a Caitlin Clark 22 Fever jersey? Maybe<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but I&rsquo;d appreciate a Natasha Howard jersey more. Tyrese Haliburton deserves all the attention, but I&rsquo;m sticking with <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/06/22/because-i-enjoy-remembering-guys/">my Bogdanavic</a>. Didn&rsquo;t the Colts have two generational talents at the most important position in football in the last couple decades? Yes they did.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> Surely I picked up one of those shirts? Absolutely not—I represent undersung linebacker Shaq Leonard (neé Darius) on game day.</p>
<p>Maybe it follows with age and maturity, but I remember music hipsters being far more exclusionary than someone in a Darren McCarty #25 sweater. I&rsquo;m not going to read much more into it than that, though. I&rsquo;ll probably just remember another guy. <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lance-stephenson-regrets-blowing-in-lebron-james-ear-and-his-hysterical-story-explains-why/">Lance Stephenson.</a></p>

			 <p>Alright, after some travel and some work obligations, time to finally sit down and write something for <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/08/02/blaugust/">Blaugust</a>. The topic du jour is AI, and I don&rsquo;t think I have laid out where I am aligned.</p>
<p>Large language models and generative AI seem useful, in the conceptual phase. Summarizing jargon-filled documents, touching up photos, maybe generating code in a language you aren&rsquo;t familiar with yet - sounds practical and dare I say helpful!</p>
<p>The problem, as with almost all current tech problems, is scale. Rather than create a useful product/service tailored to users&rsquo; wants and needs, the tech industry chases growth at all costs. That means expanding &ldquo;touch up a photo&rdquo; to generating deep fakes, and accepting that any summarized document is probably getting vacuumed into the hive mind training the next version of the LLM.</p>
<p>I personally do not have a lot of experience using LLMs. I am a state contractor, and we are expressly prohibited from using them for work (for now). But my limited experience has been underwhelming, like the time I <a href="https://pilch.me/2024/09/03/not-even-closesomehow-even-less/">tried to generate a fake email address</a>. It feels like these computer tools are great at communicating, but much worse at tasks a computer used to do well.</p>
<p>This communication &ldquo;skill&rdquo; leads to one of the biggest traps with LLMs: the attribution of thought behind that communication (succinctly summarized by <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/07/25/rusty-foster-with-the-cleanest/">Rusty Foster here</a>). There is no thought to this computer communication, just pattern matching using the entire corpus of human writing. But it seems to fool even the people creating and selling it.</p>
<p><a href="https://williamfleitch.substack.com/i/168404504/will-leitchs-rules-of-productive-ethical-unproductive-and-unethical-ai-usage">Will Leitch outlines</a> a view of AI that matches my own: there are valid uses for it, but most of the hype is geared toward the benefit of cheap, intellectually lazy people. And if you generate something with AI and pass it off as your own, you have missed the assignment completely:</p>
<blockquote>This is the thing: Writing is meaning. The reason we write things is to express some sort of meaning, to pass along important information, to convey a human emotion or sensation. It doesn’t matter whether the writing is grammatically correct, or vividly expressed. It matters that it came from you. That is the point of writing. If you ask a Chatbot to write something for you, you are being fundamentally unhuman and foundationally dishonest. ... If it requires an AI bot for you to express something to me, you and I are probably not actually friends. <cite>Will Leitch</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>I started this blog post a week ago. Could it have been written faster with ChatGPT? Maybe. But it would not have been written by me, and that is the point.</p>

			 <p>After seeing <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/06/04/colorado-road-trip/">Lord Huron at Red Rocks</a> in May, wouldn&rsquo;t you know it, they kicked off their tour to support their new album in our city. Couldn&rsquo;t pass it up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our third Lord Huron show (Indy 2022, with the kiddo), but the first one we got to hear Ends Of The Earth. The new stuff sounds fun (Cosmic Selector - out now!), but I really enjoyed the sped up versions of La Belle Fleur Sauvage and Frozen Pines. And maybe I just don&rsquo;t go to many shows, but the production design on these Lord Huron shows is incredible. The pay phone, the tube TVs, the dancers, everything. The play between the lights and the LED screen was impressive. This was how the encore started:</p>
<p><video src="https://pilch.me/uploads/2025/lh07182025.mp4" poster="https://pilch.me/uploads/2025/poster.png" controls="controls" preload="metadata"></video></p>
<p>Hadn&rsquo;t been to this amphitheatre before, and it&rsquo;s really nice. Also pretty sure I had never been to a show where someone had to be taken to what the Hold Steady called &ldquo;the chill out tent&rdquo;, but at least 2 people near us did not make it past the opener (Indigo de Souza - need to look her back catalog up, she was great).</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Besides roughly 2 months in 2015, I have been <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/10/31/phablet-couture-or-how-i/">an Android guy</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> almost since Android was a thing. My first smartphone was a Motorola Droid 2<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and I&rsquo;ve run through LG and HTC and Google phones before my current streak of Samsung Galaxies Note/Ultra. I have been around this particular block a few times. And while I don&rsquo;t follow the developments as closely as I once did, I want to take stock of where Android is in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="market-movements">Market movements</h2>
<p>I got started with Android for likely the same reason many (millennial and older) US-based customers did: AT&amp;T had an exclusive deal with the iPhone, and I was on Verizon. In my brief jaunt with an iPhone 6S Plus as my daily driver, I could not stomach being defaulted into Apple&rsquo;s messaging app, and email, and browser, etc. I am a tinkerer, and I need things to tweak and change and try to keep me engaged. There were too many launchers and clients and power-user utilities to sample on the other side of the fence.</p>
<p>There was also a plethora of hardware tweaks and differentiations between manufacturers. LG would put the <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/11/15/lg-g-flash-review/">fingerprint reader on the back of the phone</a>. HTC <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/06/05/htc-one-m-flash-review/">added a second camera</a> and started the bokeh trend. Motorola went above in beyond in letting you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moto_X_(1st_generation)#Moto_Maker">customize your phone</a>. Samsung would throw in every feature under the sun to see what sticks.</p>
<p>That is generally no longer the case. Part of that is maturity of the platform, but another big part is consolidation. Of the companies listed above, LG doesn&rsquo;t make phones anymore. Google <a href="https://www.google.com/press/motorola/">absorbed Motorola</a>, then <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-completes-full-acquisition-motorola-mobility-from-google/">un-absorbed it</a> so they could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/google-htc/">absorb HTC</a>. Samsung is still here, and so the US market is really just Google and Samsung, with one more not yet mentioned.</p>
<h3 id="plus-one">Plus one</h3>
<p>OnePlus is one of the fun wildcards keeping the Android ecosystem honest. It is the formula they have since they started - do the essentials as well or better than the competition, pare down some non-essentials for BOM cost, and come in at a price point 20-40% below comparable devices.</p>
<p>(Here I want to clarify that I am focusing on the US market, and specifically mainstream smartphones. I know that OnePlus is essentially the US subsidiary of Oppo, and that Oppo and Xiaomi and Huawei and others are all doing awesome hardware that we will never get to see stateside. I also know Boox and Fairphone and the Light Phone and many other unique hardware applications underpinned by an Android operating system. All great, worthy of a separate post, but not the subject of this one.)</p>
<p>I have always wanted OnePlus to succeed, but my one foray into OnePlus phones ended <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/07/27/had-something-new-happen-courier/">in a police report</a> because it never got delivered. Instead I re-upped as a proud Galaxy Note user.</p>
<h2 id="notes-on-notes">Notes on notes</h2>
<p>In that post linked at the top, I note the differentiator of the Note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The S-pen would probably increase smartphone adoption among the older demographic if it were packaged with more phones. There is something satisfying about pulling it out and launching the built-in note app and jotting things down. It is still not faster than typing; the last several years have conditioned me to type faster than I write. But I am still conditioned to remember things that I write down with a pen or pencil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is still extremely satisfying in 2025! In the intervening years, Samsung added a tiny battery in the S-pen, and you can use it as a remote for things like the camera shutter. No one else does this! This is the stuff that makes me love technology. Which is why it sucks that the only difference between Samsung&rsquo;s flagship 2025 and 2024 phones, as far as I can tell, is <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/01/22/samsung-goes-back-to-basics/">removing <em>this specific feature</em></a> and <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/01/24/samsungs-s-and-s-plus/">adding &ldquo;AI&rdquo; to the names of existing features</a>.</p>
<h2 id="foldable-horizon">Foldable horizon</h2>
<p>The only real ray of light, signaling any sort of ambition toward the future of mobile, is the foldable. These devices represent the only tangible innovation in the space, among a sea of 5.5 inch metal and glass candy bars. If you have not tried one, I&rsquo;m going to use the same description from the S-pen: it is extremely satisfying to mechanically shut your phone. It is fun to have a tablet that changes to fit in your pocket, or even a clamshell that fits even deeper in your pocket. True millennials know the power of slamming your phone shut at the end of a call, and it is high time to reintroduce that to smartphones. I got to use one of these (Samsung Z Fold 3) for roughly a year, and would definitely go back.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>These should be the cutting edge of mobile computing. In reality though, Samsung has finely tuned 6 separate iterations of their foldables, to the point that it seems impossible to change it either positively or negatively. Google jumped in with their own unique contender that seems to get less unique each year. Even OnePlus put out a great foldable&hellip; once. It is now 2 years old<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and doesn&rsquo;t have a successor.</p>
<h2 id="what-next">What Next?</h2>
<p>This blog was created for two purposes. First: in migrating and reading through old posts, I realized I had not put anything like this together in almost a decade. So, stretching my legs (fingers). Second, even more self-serving purpose: I am working through my thoughts on my next phone upgrade. I am currently using a Galaxy S23 Ultra (for the uninitiated, this is the &ldquo;pro&rdquo; model with every feature under the sun, including the stylus). But it is two years old, which is roughly when I have upgraded.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>But looking around, there really is nothing that improves upon what I already have. Samsung is announcing their 7th foldable in a few days, but the battery is the same size as the model I tried from 4 years ago (10% smaller than my current phone). Pixels have always had good reviews, but I am more wary than ever about investing my digital life in Google.</p>
<p>The current differentiators are: how locked into the platform are you? (Very.) How much do you trust the platform operator? (🤏.) Do you want to spend the equivalent of a budget laptop or a high-end laptop? (No comment.) Do &ldquo;AI&rdquo; features matter to you in the least? (Absolutely not.) To bring it back to the title, the Android market in 2025 is pretty dire.</p>

			 <p>ok, last Pacers post of the day and probably season. I just remembered that my only <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/06/22/because-i-enjoy-remembering-guys/">other</a> Pacers shirt was caught from a t-shirt cannon at <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202203300IND.html">this game</a> against Nikola Jokic and the Nuggets. The Pacers dug a 31-point hole in the 2nd quarter, retook the lead in the 3rd quarter, and were tied in the middle of the 4th before losing. All this to say: this team has always been like this, and I really hope it continues</p>

<p>The experience of watching the Pacers throughout this postseason run was the experience of watching such a protracted sequence of irrational things happen, to the point that they made sense. You are not supposed to steal inbounds passes, run off of every made layup, or suddenly turn into a deadeye stepback shooter. &hellip; Aaron Nesmith is not supposed to turn into Ray Allen for like two minutes and make six threes. Tyrese Haliburton is not supposed to make every potential game-winner. T.J. McConnell is not supposed to turn into Michael Jordan for five minutes of a Game 7. All-star opponents are not supposed to forget how to dribble the basketball late in games.</p>

			 <p>The <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/pacers/">Indiana Pacers</a> fell in game 7 of the NBA Finals last night. Tyrese Haliburton&rsquo;s leg exploding in slow motion proved to be a tragic end to an incredible season, and it deserves an appreciation.</p>
<p>This is a team that lost 70% of their games 3 seasons ago. Management turned over the roster and handed the keys to Tyrese Haliburton and built an offensive juggernaut out of mostly standard-issue guys. Last year they outperformed expectations by winning 2 playoff rounds, and most pundits wrote it off as a fluke.</p>
<p>I was at best a casual fan, given <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/06/22/because-i-enjoy-remembering-guys/">my only team jersey</a> was picked up on clearance after a Fever game because that guy left in free agency. But after last season, I shelled out for the local TV broadcasts (FanDuel Sports Network neé Bally Sports neé Fox Sports Midwest) so I could actually watch the games. And it did not disappoint. When everyone was healthy (after mid-December or so), this Pacers team was never fully out of a game.</p>
<p>In this year&rsquo;s playoffs, the Pacers kept up the trend. They kept running into teams with <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/04/30/bucks-collapse-leads-to-giannis/">superstars</a> and <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/05/14/pacers-headed-back-to-the/">strong cores</a>, and they kept <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/05/22/theycantkeepgettingawaywithitgif/">throwing them in the trash can</a> in <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/06/06/haliburton-has-now-made-four/">increasingly unlikely ways</a>.</p>
<p>It truly was a miraculous run, given that most metrics showed they should not have made it this far:</p>

<p>They became the first team to have 8 different players score 200+ points in a single playoff. It shows that talent-wise, having several high floors can compete with one or two high ceilings. The worst part of it all (besides the hideous injury) is that the element of surprise is gone. If they do it again, the story will just be &ldquo;there go those rascally Pacers again, punching above their weight&rdquo;. Regardless, this is the kind of season that creates lifelong fans.</p>

			 <p>I have had plenty of time to tinker since <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/01/16/alright-going-to-slowly-import/">migrating to micro.blog</a>, and something I always forgot to do on Wordpress was document tweaks and settings and plugins as I implemented them. I&rsquo;m going to try to make up for that here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve bounced between a few different themes, but I keep coming back to <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog">Tiny by Matt Langford</a>. Micro.blog has much better documentation around customizations - see <a href="https://custom.micro.blog">custom.micro.blog</a>. But Matt&rsquo;s themes (he also make Sumo and Bayou) carve out places to insert your own customizations throughout, called microhooks. Here are my customizations.</p>
<h2 id="home-page">Home page</h2>
<p>On the homepage, I updated the navigation bar to add a link to the old Wordpress blog. This is done by adding the following in the microhook-inline-nav-end.html:</p>
<p><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;old-site&quot; href=&quot;https://wp.pilch.me&quot;&gt;the old blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code></p>
<p>I also updated the pagination to <a href="https://custom.micro.blog/2019/06/30/add-number-of.html">add page numbers</a>. This was accomplished with the microhook-pagination.html file. This microhook replaces the default pagination, so I copied the entire <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> containing that html into the microhook file, and added my page numbers in between the &lsquo;older&rsquo; and &rsquo;newer&rsquo; links. I found I also had to redeclare the <code>$paginator</code> in this file in order for this to work:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ $paginator := .Paginate (where .Site.Pages.ByDate.Reverse &#34;Type&#34; &#34;post&#34;) }}
&lt;div class=&#34;post-nav&#34;&gt;
  {{ if $paginator.HasPrev }}
  &lt;span class=&#34;prev&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;{{ $paginator.Prev.URL }}&#34; title=&#34;Previous Page&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;arrow&#34;&gt;← Newer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  {{ end }}
  &lt;span class=“page-number”&gt;
	Page {{ $pag.PageNumber }} of {{ $pag.TotalPages }}
	&lt;/span&gt;
  {{ if $paginator.HasNext }}
  &lt;span class=&#34;next&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;{{ $paginator.Next.URL }}&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;arrow&#34;&gt;Older →&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id="posts">Posts</h2>
<p>I like cross-posting, and used it a lot on the old blog. I currently only cross-post to Bluesky and Mastodon, so I wanted to show links to those next to the post sent to those sites. This was pretty simple for Bluesky, but I had some issues with the Mastodon URL and had to build it with <code>printf</code> from other attributes.</p>
<p>The free fonts and icons from FontAwesome are included in Tiny Theme, so I used those for the syndication icons. All together it looks like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ if or (.Params.bluesky) (.Params.mastodon) }}
&lt;p&gt;
    Also on: 
{{ if .Params.bluesky }}
&lt;a class=&#34;u-syndication&#34; {{ printf &#34;href=%q&#34; .Params.bluesky.link | safeHTMLAttr }}&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa-brands fa-bluesky&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
{{ end }}
{{ if .Params.mastodon }}
{{ $mastolink := printf &#34;%d&#34; .Params.mastodon.id  | printf &#34;@%s/%s&#34; .Params.mastodon.username | printf &#34;%s/%s&#34; .Params.mastodon.hostname  | printf &#34;https://%s&#34; }}
&lt;a class=&#34;u-syndication&#34; {{ printf &#34;href=%q&#34; $mastolink | safeHTMLAttr }}&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa-brands fa-mastodon&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
{{ end }}
&lt;/p&gt;
  {{ end }}
</code></pre><p>I also really liked <a href="https://heyloura.com/2025/04/05/backlinks-on-a-microblog-hosted.html">Loura&rsquo;s implementation of backlinks</a>, so I rolled that into the same file. Adding both of these snippets to microhook-after-post.html displays them in the correct place.</p>
<h2 id="archive">Archive</h2>
<p>I prefer the way that <a href="https://sumo.micro.blog">Sumo Theme</a>&rsquo;s archive buttons look, better than the default bullet list in Tiny Theme. So I changed the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> to the following <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in layouts/_default/list.archivehtml.html :</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div class=&#34;archive-categories&#34;&gt;
		&lt;h3&gt;{{ T &#34;Categories&#34; }}&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;div class=&#34;category-list&#34;&gt;
			{{ range $list }}
			&lt;a href=&#34;{{ .Permalink }}&#34;&gt;&lt;button&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
			{{ end }}
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id="indieweb">Indieweb</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve long been an <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/indieweb/">indieweb</a> nerd, and part of the reason for migrating here was having much of that functionality out of the box. However, some of the baseline tags were missing - specifically the <code>h-card</code>. I tweaked the header.html file until I could validate the h-card on <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">indiewebify.me</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, I just had to wrap my avatar, site link, and description with <code>&lt;span class=&quot;h-card&quot;&gt;</code>. When I remember, I might even put this in as a pull request on these theme repositories. I know there are <code>rel=me</code> links elsewhere in the header, which may or may not belong in the h-card, but that is for future tweaking. For now my up-to-date rel=me links are on <a href="https://pilch.me/about/">my about page</a>.</p>

Haliburton has now made four game-winning or game-tying buckets in the final five seconds of a game during this postseason. That shot also gave the Pacers their fifth 15-point comeback victory in this postseason, and we are now at the point where a generation's worth of miraculous shots and outcomes have been produced by one team over the course of two months. Haliburton's shot from last night deserves to be the first thing that anyone thinks about when the 2025 Pacers are mentioned in the future, but it will have to get in line behind eight Points In 47 Seconds and Down 14 With 2:51 Left To Play.

			 <p>Got a Ray Ratto write-up at Defector for the occasion: 🔗 <a href="https://defector.com/no-one-ever-sees-the-pacers-coming">No One Ever Sees The Pacers Coming</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet there is something to this Pacers team that a certain stripe of basketball psycho has recognized, which is that they produce offense with a level of ease that few teams have, and defend with a quirky stubbornness that casuals catch onto only after the games end. They lead the league in nothing but are better than average at everything, all of which was on clear display Tuesday when they closed out the Cleveland Cavaliers, 114-105.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ratto hits on what I have been struggling to explain to friends: the Pacers don&rsquo;t have <strong><em>the guy</em></strong>. The one guy you could argue as their <strong><em>guy</em></strong> got voted the most overrated guy by all the other guys in the league (sidenote: seems fairly accurately rated now). Haliburton has had his share of great stat lines and clutch shots, but Myles Turner put the nail in the Cavs yesterday. Andrew Nembhard had one against the Bucks in round 1, and last year against the Knicks, this year&rsquo;s presumptive ECF opponent.</p>
<p>By not having <strong><em>the guy</em></strong> where everything goes through that guy, you (the opponent, and also the viewer) never know where the Pacers are going to get you. Conventional basketball wisdom was that you need <strong><em>the guy</em></strong>. But we&rsquo;ve got 2 seasons of evidence that maybe you don&rsquo;t need 1 crazy-high ceiling, just a lot of very-high floors.</p>

<p>Haliburton sized up an isolation against Allen, used a couple of fancy-looking setup dribbles to go absolutely nowhere, and then unleashed an infuriating reverse-gather crab-dribble Riverdance-ass mess of a step-back three-pointer that anyone would consider a criminal misuse of a mismatch, except that the ball went into the basket.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a characteristically far-sighted move by Vox management to liquidate their gaming vertical right before the Switch 2 release, and GTA 6 later this year. Those guys could not sell sunscreen at a beach.</p>
<p>Polygon was one of two gaming sites in my RSS reader. The other is <a href="https://Aftermath.site">Aftermath</a>. I really hope someplace like Aftermath can pick up some of these writers. Need more worker-owned publications in this media landscape.</p>

<p>This was a wild finish. Benedict Mathurin also got into it with Giannis after the game, for what I assume were separate, dumb reasons. But it made me so happy when the ball popped through Gary Trent Jr.&rsquo;s legs, after he had cooked the Pacers in OT. Giannis and Dame are so cool, it&rsquo;s too bad the rest of their team sucks</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>If you ever read this blog or my socials, there is a good chance the post you read is about the <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/boilerup/">Purdue Boilermakers</a>. While I (sometimes) enjoy the <a href="https://pilch.me/2019/06/23/063000/">football team&rsquo;s exploits</a>, my true passion is the men&rsquo;s basketball team. We are based in Indiana, after all. To folks who are unfamiliar with the joys &amp; plights Boilermaker basketball, here is the lowdown.</p>
<h3 id="school-history">School History</h3>
<p>Why is the mascot of Purdue a &ldquo;boilermaker&rdquo;? It goes back to a football game in the late 1800s. The Purdue football team travelled to nearby Wabash College for a game, and trounced them. Reporters for the local newspaper seized on the size difference between the teams&rsquo; players, and called them names, heavily implying that Purdue was employing local rail workers. &ldquo;Pumpkin-shuckers&rdquo;, &ldquo;coal heavers&rdquo;, &ldquo;blacksmiths&rdquo;, &ldquo;stevedores&rdquo;, and the one that stuck - boilermakers.</p>
<p>To this day, the official mascot is the Boilermaker Special, a road-legal vehicle built to look like a steam engine. It is the fastest official mascot in college athletics, reaching speeds of 75 mph on the highway.</p>
<h3 id="team-history">Team History</h3>
<p>The Purdue men&rsquo;s basketball team is a winner. Just not when you get to the post season.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Purdue won it&rsquo;s last national championship in 1932, before the advent of the NCAA tournament, behind the guard play of John Wooden. You may remember him from winning 10 titles as the coach of UCLA. Well, where did he learn the game?</p>
<p>The school has the most conference titles in the Big Ten, and has 36 tournament appearances to its name. But it only has 3 Final Fours and no championships to show for it. When I started following (see next section), it was a combination of <a href="https://pilch.me/2018/03/23/isaac-haas-elbow-purdue-engineers/">horrifically-timed</a> <a href="https://pilch.me/2010/02/25/171231/">injuries</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Fairleigh_Dickinson_vs._Purdue_men%27s_basketball_game">jitters/choking</a> (this one got its own Wikipedia page), and <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/boxscores/2019-03-30-20-virginia.html">just plain bad luck</a>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The obvious comparison for non-CBB fans was to the Chicago Cubs, with their famous curse and geographic proximity to northern Indiana. But they finally broke theirs. I would consider the Minnesota Vikings as a better comparison now, with the most all-times wins without a Super Bowl to show for it. Never an underdog, but never the last one standing either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they make the Final Four last year?&rdquo; Yes, a year removed from losing so bad it got it&rsquo;s own Wikipedia page, roughly the same roster stormed through the tournament and made their first Final Four since 1980. We got to play in the natty the same day as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024">Great North American Eclipse</a> passed through. As a fan, I would guess we will be back when the next eclipse rolls through in 20 years or so.</p>

<h4 id="player-appreciation">Player appreciation</h4>
<p>Of course there are the recent All-Americans and draft picks. Zach Edey was the first back-to-back consensus national player of the year in 4 decades. Carsen Edwards had no shooting conscience, and was allowed to go supernova, breaking Steph Curry&rsquo;s tournament shooting records. Robbie Hummel, E&rsquo;Twaun Moore and Jajuan Johnson catapulted Matt Painter&rsquo;s recruiting, dubbed the Baby Boilers. And Hummel is now an outstanding color commentator for national CBB broadcasts.</p>
<p>And part of the reason I started this blog was to publish my bonafides on current Big Ten player of the year and All-American point guard Braden Smith.</p>
<p><img src="https://pilch.me/uploads/2025/21b538a8c0.jpg" alt="Group chat snapshot from one of his first games. My message: Braden Smith appears to have &ldquo;the juice&rdquo;"></p>
<p>True fans, though, have a soft spot for the guys who are not at the top of the scouting report. Shout outs to Gordon Watt, Chris Lutz, Keaton Grant, Chris Kramer, Marcus Green and Bobby Riddell, from my formative fan years. My Purdue jersey, although Camden Heide and Jaden Ivey are the most recent wearers of the number, is a Lewis Jackson jersey.</p>
<h3 id="my-history">My History</h3>
<p>My freshman year coincided with a changing of the guard in the men&rsquo;s basketball team. Gene Keady had just retired, at the time the second-winningest coach in Big Ten history. His protege was a former player who had just seen some success as the head coach at Southern Illinois.</p>
<p>My friends and I had season tickets, and joined the student section, which needed to be renamed. It was previously &ldquo;The Gene Pool&rdquo;, and so to hold the theme it was now called &ldquo;The Paint Crew&rdquo;, in honor of new coach Matt Painter.</p>
<p>Coach Painter went 9-19 in that first year at Purdue. That did not matter &ndash; it was a magical experience. Again, shout out to Gary Ware, Chris Lutz, Marcus Green and Bobby Riddell. I&rsquo;ve never yelled as loud as I did when we knocked off Michigan that year. Even in a down year, Mackey Arena is a special place. We were hooked for life.</p>
<p>The next year, Painter took Carl Landry and David Teague back to the NCAA tournament, and despite maybe 1-2 exceptions, has fielded a team competing for conference (and sometimes national) titles basically every year since. He has the 4th-most wins in Big Ten History, behind 3 guys who coached 5-10 years longer than he has, and will likely pass his mentor in the next couple years.</p>
<p>I have not been back since pre-Covid, but when I see it on TV I can feel Mackey Arena in my bones. It is the loudest venue I have ever been, referred to as <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/purdue/basketball/2017/12/02/opposing-players-describe-experience-playing-mackey-arena/913984001/">&lsquo;a concrete dungeon of sound&rsquo;</a> regularly reaching 120db jet-engine levels during conference play. I get hearing loss just remembering games there.</p>
<h3 id="the-future">The Future</h3>
<p>It feels bright! Even though Purdue is tipping off against High Point as I publish this (As I fan I hear High Point and it rhymes with VCU and Little Rock and North Texas). I know Coach Painter is not going to get several future NBA stars onto a team together. He is going to find unsung recruits and turn them into school legends. Maybe not March legends, but January legends at the very least.</p>

<p>I will never post a video of this game, but the bad luck part is pretty obvious if you watch the final seconds of regulation.

<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<p>Most of 2021 was spent trying to restore a rhythm that had been lost during the pandemic. Getting a kid back in school, changing work clients, traveling to see people that we couldn&rsquo;t the prior year. It takes a lot of focus away from little things, like blogging.</p>
<h2 id="2022">2022</h2>
<p>I endear myself to my new-<a href="https://pilch.micro.blog/2020/03/14/new-beginnings/">ish</a> employer enough to take on a major project, which goes to production during this year. Taught myself how to do API testing.</p>
<p>Oh, and we adopted Willow, our Irish wolfhound - poodle mix. She started so small, and is now 80 pounds.</p>
<p><img src="https://pilch.micro.blog/uploads/2025/7594cb6d123ffbf8.jpg" alt="Willow, as a puppy"></p>
<p>My social media habits migrated from Twitter to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@pilch">Mastodon</a>, as shadow president ruined the former.</p>
<h2 id="2023">2023</h2>
<p>No big deal, just had another kid lol. Grey was born 4 weeks early, but is all caught up and toddlering around.</p>
<p>I snagged an invite to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/craig.pilch.me">Bluesky</a> around July, and tried to rebuild my posting muscles there. But it always felt like something was missing (it was my blog).</p>
<h2 id="2024">2024</h2>
<p>My 2024 started with a car accident lol. Everybody was fine (on our end), but we were hit and run while going through a green light at an intersection. If you can afford a Volvo, I apparently endorse them with my life.</p>
<p>The rest of 2024 was picking up another large API project at work, and remembering how much work a toddler is lol.</p>
<h2 id="2025-so-far">2025 so far</h2>
<p>Something prompted an urge to return to the blogs. Maybe the state of the world made me want to give me something that I could control. But the <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/02/12/microblog-import-status/">state of my Wordpress backend</a> necessitated a <a href="https://pilch.me/2025/01/16/alright-going-to-slowly-import/">move to Micro.blog</a>. So that is where I am at - back to blogging.</p>

			 <p>Part of the impetus for importing my Wordpress into micro.blog is the amount of errors caused by trying and forgetting various plug-ins over the years.</p>
<p><img src="https://pilch.micro.blog/uploads/2025/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This screen is from bulk updating posts (to add an export tag, so I can move things in smaller pieces). Hitting back in the browser shows that the bulk update succeeded, but it does this <em>every time</em>. If I had more time, I might be able to sit down and figure this out. But right now, forward progress is getting all the relevant content to the new host.</p>
<p>So far I&rsquo;m back to imported FB posts from over 10 years ago. After that, it will be deciding what to do with link posts, which will require some reformatting. But progress is progress.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other AI abilities are just as familiar, but we didn’t always call them AI. Take AI Select, accessed from Samsung’s Edge Panel, which gives “suggested actions” like cropping and sharing screenshots, creating GIFs from videos, or adding events to your calendar. It replaces Smart Select, which did most of that, too, but with a different design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>🔥🔥🔥</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The S25 phones also offer a daily summary called Now Brief that lets you know what’s on your calendar for the day or how your commute looks, bringing us back full circle to 2012’s Google Now. Meanwhile, the Now Bar is Samsung’s answer to Apple’s Dynamic Island: a lockscreen element that can show sports scores and Google Maps navigation instructions or tell you what song is playing. It sounds useful, but is it AI? Apple didn’t think so.</p>

			 <p>I only have a bit to add to the correct notion here that <a href="https://pilch.me/2021/2021-01-03-0111/">2020 is not worth recapping</a>. I was extraordinarily fortunate and lucky over the past year. I <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/new-beginnings/">got a new job</a>, and no one in my immediate bubble has caught the plague going around. I was able to <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/quarantine-journal/">chronicle how different everything was</a>.</p>
<p>The only thing to add to this notion is a general, simmering rage that has been building since March. From forcing everything to reopen, to brand new kindergarten students having to learn over Zoom calls, to seeing other countries able to hold large gatherings in the fall, to watching helplessly as <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/americas-vaccine-rollout-disaster.html">doses of the miraculous vaccination expire, unused</a>. My trust in basically everyone currently in a position of power is gone, unlikely to be repaired. <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/list-of-bail-funds-for-protestors-bail-funds/">Little acts</a> along the way help, but I am not sure the rage will ever subside.</p>
<p>I will think about other little acts while I go <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/hosting-multiple-tiddlywikis-on-node/">noodle around some more with TiddlyWiki</a>.</p>

<p>During the primaries, the mild, establishment candidate muscles out a popular challenger from the left, securing their party nomination.

<p>Aforementioned mild candidate then does not worry about creating an affirmative case for themself, and why would they? Their opponent is obviously bad. Much easier to say "wow, doesn't that guy suck?" than to create plans to help fix the myriad of things that are broken. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This mild candidate does not campaign in battleground states (this time around, because it's responsible and prudent), instead focused on fundraising from large-money donors. </p>

<p>Polling goes heavy in this candidate's favor.

<p>Yesterday was harrowing for many reasons, and I want to write them all out for posterity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:more -->
<!-- /wp:more -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We woke at 6am to the sound of my father-in-law bailing water out of our basement, which had flooded. Water bubbling up from under our front walk - the well line had broken, so I shut off our water. Spent the next few hours drying it out. Talked to the people that installed the well, who told us he would need an excavating tool which he did not have to get through any tree roots, etc., to fix it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brief work phone call to find out our project end date has been moved up 2 months by our client, to October 1. No pressure, but not something you expect to hear very often.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Occasional social media checks show someone shot 3 protesters in Kenosha, killing 2. Horrifying details emerge over the rest of the day, interspersed with hurricane and pandemic news.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Called several neighbors, checked BBB, to get names of excavators. Couldn't get ahold of anyone until mid- to late-afternoon, and no one would be able to come out today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Took a walk to blow off steam with the wife. Saw a couple small squirrels cross the road ahead of us. When we catch up to that point, we are startled by a snake who, upon further inspection, is eating one of the squirrels. Ominous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Heard back from insurance company, who will cover the water damage but not the well repair (apparently a standard practice). Understandable but disappointing. Also, they have no contacts to suggest for the repair - more disappointing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wildcat strike by the Milwaukee Bucks, followed by the rest of the NBA teams on that days schedule, then WNBA, MLB, and MLS. Baller move, fills me with hope. I hope this pushes things forward in the right direction.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve had this on my mind for a few years now, and was reminded by this article about how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations">Apple will reject Stadia and xCloud</a> from the App Store. I&rsquo;m a fan of both of those services so far, but my thoughts are tangential to Apple&rsquo;s locked down platform. The nit I am picking is with search.</p>
<p>There is an almost throwaway line in Apple&rsquo;s policy about how all the games would need to be reviewed and available in search. In direct relation to this issue, the policy is dumb and will likely fold, either to antitrust inquiries or backdoor handshake deals (or both). It creates a bad user experience (people who want to use the service on iOS cannot) for the sake of a good user interface.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t fault them for it. In my 10 years using smartphones, I was able to switch to iOS for an entire 6 weeks, around the end of 2015. The only thing that still haunts me as an Android user is Spotlight Search.</p>
<p>It underscores the core design difference between the two systems. There is a single iOS which everyone experieces, but users bring along their individual stuff into the walled garden. On Android, you are generally encourged to create your own unique experience, which is rewarding in itself. However, trying to access personal items is a hassle, as search is almost always pointed outward toward the G-shaped hive mind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve spent several weeks organizing personal notes, experimenting with new tools. The interoperability and longevity of plaintext notes has proven particular alluring, and quite useful in practice. But if I want to perform a mobile search that includes my personal files as well as relevant emails/todos/etc., I am out of luck. The market leader to end all market leaders of internet search fails to accomplish this, and probably on purpose, because again, all search points outward by design.</p>
<p>Anyways, this has been bugging me for years, and won&rsquo;t get any better because I just got my next Android phone. On a related note, I look forward to <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> coming to mobile.</p>

			 <p>I was lucky enough to <a href="https://pilch.me/2011/2019-03-22-1649/">get into Google Music</a> early, by invitation. I have used it ever since, with a 1-month hiatus <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/02/13/streaming-music-throwdown/">around 2014</a> to determine that Rdio was the best streaming service available (lol). In reality, the only option at the time for people with iPod-filling-sized music collections was Google Music. You could probably run a Subsonic server or something, but that stuff was for nerds. This was one of the largest companies in the world, offering a consumer solution for a consumer problem.</p>
<p>This was all before the wide realization of Google&rsquo;s penchant for killing its offerings that people actually liked. But this one has obviously been much harder - they&rsquo;ve started trying to kill their original music service <a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2018/05/18/google-play-music-youtube-premium-price/">over 2 years ago</a> with no luck.</p>
<p>Youtube (in terms of branding) is already a step down. It has its own trouble with extremism, etc. Also, streaming music on Youtube always seemed like an anachronism to me - your medium is wrong, you are using unnecessary bandwidth, also you aren&rsquo;t cool enough to have amassed your own collection. Can&rsquo;t beat (ad-supported) free, I guess.</p>
<p>Grandfathering into <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2013/06/30/psa-todays-the-last-day-to-take-advantage-of-google-music-all-access-for-7-99-per-month/">the early adopter&rsquo;s rate</a> has saved me roughly $160 so far, over Spotify and others. May not be enough monetarily to justify staying, but it is enough to say I got in before it was cool. And to people who curate music collections, that is worth more lol.</p>
<p>The wrench in all this is I got a 3 month trial to Tidal, and it is going pretty well so far. It apparently can be <a href="https://www.plex.tv/music/">combined with Plex</a>, which may be getting back to that holy grail of mine + theirs. Will have a decision to make soon.</p>

		<a href="https://pilch.me/2020/06/20/hosting-multiple-tiddlywikis-on-node/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-06-20 15:01:41 -0400">Jun 20, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I only recently<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="fn1">1</a></sup> found out about <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com">TiddlyWiki</a>, and immediately became enamored with it. After a couple months of playing with individual files, today I made a breakthrough today in hosting TiddlyWiki on my site.</p>
<p>I tried a few ways to initialize with cPanel on my current host, without any luck (I may return to this next, now that I&rsquo;ve seen it in action. It turned out to be much easier to spin up a DigitalOcean droplet with Node, and follow the instructions in <a href="https://blog.joshsullivan.io/2019/02/20/creating-online-tiddlywiki">this guide from Josh Sullivan.</a> The only modification I made was to use <code>pm2</code> instead of <code>forever</code> (as DigitalOcean already had it configured). I found another article on <a href="https://medium.com/@mc_bloomfield/getting-tiddlywiki-to-run-in-the-background-using-pm2-b104a8f60de8">initializing pm2 with Tiddlywiki</a>, and I used the following command in place of <code>forever</code>:</p>
<p><code>pm2 start &ndash;name wikiprocessname /lib/node_modules/tiddlywiki/tiddlywiki.js &ndash; nameofwikifolder &ndash;listen author=name username=name password=yourpassword &ldquo;readers=(anon)&quot;</code></p>
<p>Now, my experimentation with TiddlyWiki involved saving single html files and playing with each individually. I ended up with a few single-topic wikis - one for archiving my old notebooks, one for my video game collection, etc. I may combine at some point, but I thought it would be better for now to host individually. All that needed to happen, at least with the DigitalOcean reverse proxy setup, was to initialize nginx correctly.</p>
<code>
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/DOMAIN2.COM
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/DOMAIN3.COM
</code>
<p>Then in each file, make sure the port is unique and the URL matches. Symbol links for each:</p>
<code>
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/DOMAIN2.COM /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/DOMAIN3.COM /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
</code>
<p>Rerun certbot if needed for these URLs, then intialize each in pm2:</p>
<p><code>pm2 start &ndash;name wikiprocessname /lib/node_modules/tiddlywiki/tiddlywiki.js &ndash; nameofwikifolder &ndash;listen port=#### author=name username=name password=yourpassword &ldquo;readers=(anon)&quot;</code></p>
<p>You can play with the various arguments for the TiddlyWiki webserver <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/#WebServer">outlined here</a>. I made a couple available to only myself for now by removing &ldquo;readers=(anon)&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t forget to run <code>pm2 save</code> so your server stays up.</p>
<p>Going to keep playing, but right now <a href="https://wiki.pilch.me">my commonplace book</a> is live with barely anything in it. Hope this helps someone get theirs off the ground as well.</p>

    <li>Promptness is a sign of respect.</li>
    <li>Trust me: there is no "them".</li>
    <li>Art is in what you leave out.</li>
    <li>Pros are just amateurs who know how to cover their mistakes.</li>
    <li>Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.</li>

			 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've been meaning to do this for a month, and got halfway through a couple drafts, but here are my <a href="https://werd.io/2020/four-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four questions</a> for the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:more -->
<!-- /wp:more -->
<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>1. What did you do today?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today I got ahead of some test case writing for our next SW release. I started writing tests for a defect that, as it turns out, cannot be fixed until some COVID-19 related change requests are rolled back out. So, on to other tasks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the personal project side, I am working through annotating my old notebooks. My original plan was using Evernote OCR, but their price hike has me looking other places. I tried Notion for this, but now I'm experimenting with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://tiddlywiki.com/" target="_blank">TiddlyWiki</a>. It is time consuming, but also a good in-depth review, which is part of the point of keeping a notebook.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later, I introduced my son to Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. This was probably a mistake, as he can't quite read all the dialog, and thus gets very frustrated by the man trying to teach him sword techniques. Will probably try to get him into Scribblenauts for the time being - he is getting too good at Smash Bros. and Mario Kart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
</div></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>2. What did you enjoy?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I relish any chance to get out of the house now, even if it's just a short grocery trip. I use the time in the car by myself to scream sing some of my favorite songs. This time it was Entitlement Crew by The Hold Steady.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:core-embed/youtube {"url":"[youtu.be/u2qnbkhH8...](https://youtu.be/u2qnbkhH8DQ)","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"youtube","className":"wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"} -->

</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/youtube -->
</div></div>
<!-- /wp:group -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also am figuring out how to spend leisure time, around a house where there is always another project to pick up. The backlog of projects and leisure activities both have never felt bigger, since you are always in their proximity now, and it is good to be able to balance them. I am nearly finished with A Link To The Past, and hope to knock out The Outer Worlds soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>3. What did you find difficult?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watching people try to go back to the way things were already. The large Memorial day gatherings. Seeing the data about how other countries have nearly wiped out the threat of the virus, while meanwhile we are "re-"opening before the case numbers have even peaked in most places.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>4. What has changed?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the last two months, so much. This is difficult to quantify, as we were in the middle of a lot of change already. I started <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/new-beginnings/">this new job</a>, and have spent a total of 1 day in the office. Our kid has stayed home for most of that time, and is just now beginning to get restless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And now, since this is my first entry, on to the stretch questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. What are you grateful for?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am so thankful for our health. We are in an extremely privileged position to be able to isolate ourselves, and I know many are not so lucky. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. What changes do you want to keep?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At work, our project lead now has data for our clients that we are actually more productive from home, and, among other proposals to them on when to return, proposed staying remote permanently. I would not be opposed to this, although at this point I would love the option to go into the office (or somewhere) occasionally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. What are you scared of?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Same as everyone else - dying alone, isolated from those close to me. Woke me up briefly last night, thinking about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We are also living with an immuno-compromised person, so becoming a vector for the virus is also a big fear at the moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. What has stayed the same?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Day to day, things have normalized (in contrast to question 4). We have a routine now. <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/dog-blog/">Charlie</a> is probably to the point where he misses his alone time during the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. When did you last laugh?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have not had much trouble laughing, when the moment is right (again, we are very lucky). The hardest I've laughed over the last couple months was <a href="https://pilch.me/2020/2020-04-26-0323/">watching Popstar</a>. In the last few days, my biggest laugh was seeing this dumb tweet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:core-embed/twitter {"url":"[twitter.com/dykefataI...](https://twitter.com/dykefataIe/status/1264883705778241537?s=09)","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"twitter","className":""} -->

  If you played games in the early 2000s, you probably did so on a Game Boy Advance. First introduced in 2001 as a purple, vaguely hexagonal brick, the hardware boost alone over the Game Boy Color’s archaic tech ushered in an era of lush pixelated gameplay. Then came the ultra-stylish Game Boy Advance SP. Complete with flip-phone-like functionality and a light-up screen, one thing was certain: Game Boy Advance was the handheld of the generation. By the end of its impressive run, enough excellent games came out to fill the Library of Alexandria. Here, as decided by the writers and editors of Kotaku, are the cream of the crop.

<blockquote>
  It’s one of those images that stays with you forever: Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player who ever lived, collapsing helplessly into the arms of Scottie Pippen following Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals. Ignoring the limitations of his flu-ravaged body, Jordan mustered a spectacular 38-point performance to elevate his Chicago Bulls over the Utah Jazz, paving the way for his fifth championship in seven years. Now, nearly two decades later, those who were there for the storied game have come together to describe what it was like to be part of history.

			 <p>I am lucky enough to be in both the <a href="https://pilch.me/2019/2019-11-30-1909/">(soft-)launch of Google Stadia</a> and the <a href="https://pilch.me/2019/2019-11-20-0229/">beta of project xCloud</a> from Microsoft. Some thoughts on the differences between the two:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stadia works a bit like Xbox Live. You pay a monthly fee, and get a couple games added to your library each month. You lose access if you lapse the subscription, but regain them if you renew again. Xbox costs half as much if you pay annually - not sure Stadia offers that yet.</li>
    <li>xCloud has 2 options at the moment - stream games from their servers (similar to Stadia), or stream your own games from your own console (this requires opt-in for beta testing the OS on your console).</li>
    <li>While both work best on 5 GHz band wifi, Stadia gives a more general "you're good!" connection status, while xCloud will specifically tell you to get on 5 GHz for the best performance. The difference here is you can keep going on Stadia, and xCloud will generally lag and shutdown the stream to change the connection.</li>
    <li>Playing a console game on a phone isn't terrible, but is not yet ideal. As it becomes more widespread, I would guess games would adapt their display settings for this, but right now, it's a lot of tiny text menus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the biggest difference is the platform buy-in (and I suspect this will be the case with Nvidia GeForce Now as well, if they can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing">stop hemorrhaging games</a>). I have nearly 15 years of game saves and purchases and achievements on one of these platforms. One of the best reasons to set that aside would be ubiquity - if I can pick up a game and play on any screen<a id="fnref-apple" class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-apple"><sup>1</sup></a>, it would be hard to beat the convenience.<a id="fnref-quarantine" class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-quarantine"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Google has that opportunity, if it wants. The next play is for your triple-A game library to follow you wherever you go. They&rsquo;ve just got to move quickly, before someone else beats them to it.</p>

As with any rewarding endeavor, I constantly went back and forth between &ldquo;I need to leave this place&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to retire here.&rdquo; Ended up going with the first one, but I got nine years of experience and friendships to show for it.</p>
<p>It was bittersweet. I am simultaneously excited for the future, and sad to leave my coworkers (if any of you find this - Hi! I have a blog). I wish them all the best - they are well equipped for the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>I accepted a job offer to return to software testing - this time on web and consumer-facing applications. That was two weeks ago, and now there is a high possibility that my onboarding Monday will be remote. Pandemics move fast. Still extremely excited, with that twinge of apprehension that comes with speeding toward the unknown.</p>
<p>To new beginnings.</p>

			 <p>Our kid is in imaginary friend stage. The thing is, his imaginary friend is named Pappy. Pappy is his other dad.</p>
<p>Pappy is constantly one-upping us, his actual parents. Pappy lives on a lake with his pet shark, Hammy. Pappy&rsquo;s house is a little bigger than our new house, but &ldquo;not as big as a building. It&rsquo;s like 68 meters tall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very matter-of-fact, as I was walking out of his room after saying goodnight, he called me back to tell me something. &ldquo;I need you to go tell Mommy this: Pappy robbed a bank and then he had to go to jail. Ok, goodnight Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyway, watch this space for further Pappy updates, to find out how he has humiliated us this time.</p>

			 <p>In late December 2009 I was playing Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in my college apartment, and got into a spat with my girlfriend, who was disappointed that I was spending money on games and not thinking about the future. That capped off the previous decade.</p>
<p>From there, I got a ring proposed in March, graduated college the next December, got a job and got married in 2011, got <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/dog-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlie</a> in 2012, bought a house in 2013, <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/dadzone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had a kid</a> in <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/baby-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015</a>, moved and helped Jessie start law school also in 2015. Most of the rest can be pieced together <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/year-in-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from previous years-in-review</a>. Basically, we have all come a long way, and it has been a great decade.</p>
<p>2019 has been a hectic and fulfilling year, both professionally and personally. At work we are nearing production release for our first Agile-led project. At home, we are adjusting to Jessie graduating, passing the bar, and becoming a lawyer. We are capping it off by buying a house, but that is going to be a 2020 story.</p>

<p>I did not see many movies, but <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pilch/list/best-of-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these were the best ones</a> that I did see. Here’s my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pilch/list/best-of-the-2010s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decade list</a> - still a work in progress</p>
<p>Best <span class="small-caps">TV</span> of the year, in my opinion, was The Good Place, Game of Thrones final season, The Witcher, and Good Omens.</p>
<h2 id="resolutions">Resolutions</h2>
<p>My goals and resolutions for the new year will be close to the same as last year. I need to connect with my community, and I need to stick with my good habits. Here is a sampling of those - I made good on getting thrifty on lunch, but not quite on the notebooking habit. I dropped off on drinking water instead of coffee/soda. I also started reading a lot more when I figured out the login to my library’s ebook lending program.</p>

<blockquote>
  Are you sitting down? I’ve got something to tell you—something that may shock you. Between the events of the various Donkey Kong games, the Kong family was involved in a bitter and vicious war. Among its many casualties, this war may have claimed the life of a classic Kong character, explaining his disappearance from all future games in the series.

			 <p>One of the first RSS feeds I added to Google Reader (RIP) was Deadspin (also RIP). It was always a bright spot in the day, opening the Funbag or Dadspin or the latest goofy/dumb/weird sports blog.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I will miss Deadspin. It’s voice was funny, irreverent, and genuine, and it was home to several fantastic writers. Others will eulogize the site better, but I will say I started my blog around the time I started reading Deadspin regularly.</p>
<p>Here are my favorites, in no particular order. Read them with several ad blockers on, if you don’t want your RAM to melt.</p>

<blockquote>
  There are two versions of President Donald Trump that appear in public. They both inhabit the same body—the same Youppi-shaped torso pitched forward at the same implausible angles, same ghost-pale eyelids fluttering alarmingly, same resplendent candyfloss Kangol of hair stuck on top of it like a weird hat—but don’t really seem to be the same person. Both are president, and both seem somehow to have just been informed of that fact. Only one seems to be enjoying it. That one is not the Official Trump that sniffs and mutters and struggles with prompters and prepared text, and who only barely makes it through even the most rote ceremonial duties. Most of the time, though, and whenever Trump has to do something he finds boring or lame for an audience that isn’t allowed to hoot or chant, that version is the one America gets.

<blockquote>
  It is a problem for President Donald Trump that it’s often  impossible to tell what the hell he’s talking about. This is not one of those signature Trump defects that can readily be spun into a secret strength or as a subtle bit of advanced dealcraft that only experts and initiates can appreciate. His mind is a  television that changes channels every three seconds and where every channel has an infomercial on it; it cycles day and night without ever quite cohering into a signal. There is plenty of noise, though, and because Trump so utterly lacks discernment he is constantly interrupting himself with some new bit or blurt. As a result, his average sentence is a parade of wild upstage moves in which whatever thought he’s had most recently is forever blundering  into and past the one he had just begun to express—imagine one of those halftime shows at a NBA game in which people throw down wild dunks after leaping off trampolines except there’s a new guy jumping on the trampoline every second and there are frequent midair collisions. Trump also only knows about a hundred words, about a third of which refer to volume or size.

<blockquote>
  The Butterfly Effect is the idea that a solitary flap of a butterfly’s wings will eventually result in a hurricane halfway across the globe. In the interests of moving forward as a society, and because I don’t think I’ve seen a butterfly in, like, four years, I believe it is time to retire this term and go with something a bit different: the porno effect. It’s fairly self-explanatory, I think, but in case you’re still not following, here’s where I got the idea: merely by posting the word “porno” on the official Jeremy Renner app, I single-handedly obliterated, uh... the official Jeremy Renner app.

  For about a month now, I do journaling again. Every evening before I go to bed, I try to write down everything that comes to my mind. I usually write what I have done that day, what my emotions where and other things that I thought about during the day. It has a very positive effect to do that. I wrote about that more detailed on my German blog (Google’s translation).

			 <p>This was our third Hold Steady show. First one was the Pitchfork Music Festival in 2008, and second was in <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/hold-steady-the-vogue/">Indianapolis in 2014.</a></p>
<p>The Hold Steady has been my go-to since early college, and it has aged much better than other favorites from that time. I maintain that had I not been listening to their first 3 albums on continuous loop for the last 72 hours before finals, I would not have completed my microcontrollers class project and would have failed out of college. Same went the next semester with compilers class. Saved by Barfruit Blues and A Multitude of Casualties.</p>
<p>My only note was that I was looking forward to hearing "Chicago Seemed Tired Last Night", and did not, maybe because it was their first of 3 nights in Chicago and they hadn't been in Chicago last night. I did enjoy their cover of the opening band's song "Fresh Pope."</p>

  In March, a young  whale beached itself in Davao City, in the Philippines. When scientists from the local museum—it is, delightfully, called D’Bone Collector Natural History Museum—did a necropsy on the whale after its death, they discovered that it had starved to death because its stomach contained an astonishing 88 pounds of plastic trash. Food that might have given the whale actual nourishment simply could not fit around the sea garbage that the poor creature had consumed during its brief life, which National Geographic described as “two dense basketballs of trash,” each of which was hard as a baseball. “By the time we hit 16 rice sacks,” the museum’s curator Darrell Blatchley told National Geographic, “on top of the plastic bags, and the snack bags, and big tangles of nylon ropes, you’re like—seriously?”

<blockquote>
  Five years ago, the Hold Steady released Teeth Dreams, their last album. That was the last time they functioned like a regular band. Since then, the great word-spewing Brooklyn rockers have switched things up. Where they once toured relentlessly, they now settle into a single city for a quick residency, playing a bunch of shows in one location. And where they once cranked out classic albums, they've been taking things easier, releasing a track or two at a time on Bandcamp. The Hold Steady started that process in 2017, when they dropped "Entitlement Crew" and "A Snake In The Shower." And they've done it a bunch more times since then; just a few months ago, they did it with "The Last Time That She Talked To Me." That part-timer schedule has allowed them to keep going, and it's let frontman Craig Finn keep making solo albums like this year's I Need A New War. But now, finally, we're getting another new Hold Steady album.

<blockquote>
  An ecstatic Elite Eight duel between Virginia and Purdue on Saturday night ended in Boilermaker heartbreak. Despite the superhuman efforts of junior guard Carsen Edwards, who tried with all his might to drag Purdue to the Final Four, the Cavaliers came out with an improbable 80-75 victory.
</blockquote>
<p>It was a joy to watch these guys, especially during the tournament. I really wish that final sequence (in regulation and OT) could have gone differently, but if that is the last game for Carsen, you couldn&rsquo;t ask for anything more. They left it all in the court</p>

<blockquote>
  After three straight years of getting dumped out of the NCAA Tournament in the Sweet Sixteen, Purdue is finally going to the Elite Eight. They seemed headed for a breezy win over Tennessee for the bulk of their game tonight, but a wild Tennessee comeback probably should have been enough to steal the game for the Volunteers and hang another brutal defeat on Purdue. Instead, Ryan Cline went off, and Purdue won in overtime, 99-94.

			 <h3 id="and-2017-as-well">(and 2017 as well)</h3>
<p>What a year(s) it has been. Even if I had written a year in review post for 2017, 2018 still felt like it was five and a half years. But, like 2017, I do not feel like writing <a href="https://pilch.me/2016/year-in-review-2016-or-the-last-thing-anyone-wants-to-read-right-now">one</a> <a href="https://pilch.me/2016/year-in-review-2015-and-week-in-review-2016/">of</a> <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/year-listicle-in-review-2014">these</a> <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/year-in-review-2013">posts</a> this year. Maybe it is because it is not as fun as it used to be. Maybe it is because all the things I would put here are already posted, <a href="https://pilch.me/kind/repost/">categorized</a> <a href="https://pilch.me/kind/like/">neatly</a> without the need for an EOY summary.</p>
<p>The major theme for me of the past 1-2 years is that I feel like I could not keep up. Everything moved fast, and seemed to constantly accelerate. Professional responsibilities changed, which was exciting and harrowing. Our toddler is a big kid, to the point where he wants to do everything but can’t just yet. The world at large seems to hurdle between inspiration and death spiral, practically minute to minute.</p>
<p>So I’m going to use some of the scrum training we got this year for a full-blown retrospective.<sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="what-went-well">what went well</h2>
<p>I enjoyed sharing my interests with our son. He is <a href="https://pilch.me/2018/toddler-media-diet/">old enough</a> to follow and play Telltale Lego games, and enjoys Lego Batman, the Incredibles, and playing as Cappy in Super Mario Odyssey. There was also at least one occasion where he got multiple KO’s in Smash.</p>
<p>We were able to sell our house after failing to do so 3 years ago. It was a great starter house, but it was on the verge of becoming a burden, and now it is someone else’s problem.</p>
<p>I am fairly sure I have not logged in to Facebook in 8-10 months. My wife finally got around to deleting her account - it is probably time for me to do the same.</p>
<h2 id="what-didnt-go-well">what didn’t go well</h2>
<p>I am consistently depressed by the state of America writ large, and unsure of how to improve it, which feeds the depression because I then feel complicit in the problem. This goes back to <a href="http://pilch.me/2016/year-in-review-2015-and-week-in-review-2016#resolutionofthenewyear">recognizing privilege</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-improve">what to improve</h2>
<p>On a personal level, I need to address my more materialistic urges. I have plenty, and am due for a major konmari.</p>
<p>I spend a lot of free time consuming things, and need to find a project where I can make something instead.</p>
<p>I also need to keep up with the journal habit. In 2017 I filled 9 or 10 pocket notebooks, but only did 3 or 4 in 2018. I’ve picked it back up for this first week of 2019, and I already have a much clearer head.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, I need to figure out how to engage with my community. It’s hard to find the time and energy and cause, but I still need to get out of my shell and help once in a while.</p>
<h2 id="for-now">for now…</h2>
<p>I will go drink a beer with a picture of a fish on it, and do some dad things.</p>
<p>This is the most I’ve written in a long time - need to get back in this habit too.</p>

  Every once in a while I go on the prowl for deals. I’m a gamer after all, but also a human being with a car loan and overdue heating bills and a weakness for the artisanal pasta that costs three times as much as the generic store brand. Deals matter—without them I’d be forced to replay The Witcher 3 for a third time. That’s how I found myself on the trade-in page of Gamestop’s website today, face to face with one of the boldest gaming deals of all time.

<blockquote>
  One of the first things we hear Craig Finn snarl on his band's 2004 debut album is a simple declaration of intent: "We gotta start it off with a positive jam!" This — and Finn's decade-by-decade American history barrage that precedes it — is where the legend of the Hold Steady, America's premier bookish, beerish, don't-call-them-a-bar-band bar band, begins. Both positivity and jamming have remained the Hold Steady’s mission statement for nearly 15 years. In that time, they’ve lived a dozen lives across six albums, hundreds of whiskey-drenched shows, and minor lineup retooling. Now, the band’s enjoying a career high point, reunited with beloved mustachioed piano man Franz Nicolay (who rejoined in 2016 after six years away) and playing multi-night blowout shows whenever they want, freed from the burdens of album-cycle touring. There's also their newest music, three excellent pairs of standalone tracks that began dropping in late 2017.

			 <p>Satisfying an itch I’ve had for a while, I am working on migrating the back end of <a href="https://pilch.me/">pilch.me</a> from <a href="https://withknown.com">Known</a> back to WordPress. I love Known, but this has been a long time coming. It’s probably my own fault for <a href="https://pilch.me/2015/beginning-the-move-to-known">migrating</a> 6 weeks before becoming a new dad (and taking on more at work), but I thought I would have more time to familiarize myself with the inner workings of the platform, to tinker and break things and fix them. I decidedly did not, so I’m heading back to the familiarity of WordPress.</p>
<p>When I initially migrated, Known had a lot of the Indieweb elements baked in (webmention, early micropub, post formats, etc), and the WP plugins lagged a bit behind. Now they are caught up, while Known development has slowed significantly. I feel a bit like part of the problem, since I’m not sticking with it. But I also do not currently have the time nor patience to figure out how to modify mySQL elements, or maintain URL rewrite rules and .htaccess files. I need to step back into a platform where I don’t have to worry about nuts and bolts, and customizing basic/intermediate elements is taken care of in a GUI.</p>
<p>I’m doing the migration manually, post by post. Known exported as RSS, and I was able to import that to start (WP’s built-in RSS importer threw errors, so I had to use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/import-xml-feed/">this</a>). This method created a lot of formatting issues with line feeds, lists, etc., which is why I am doing each post individually. This gives me a chance to review some old posts I forgot about, and also the ability to idly update posts during down time at work (the network there is extremely locked down, and would not allow external SSH/FTP connections).</p>
<p>The current WP install is at <a href="https://blog.pilch.me/">blog.pilch.me</a>. I’ll probably keep the Known install, and figure out a subdomain for that when I am ready to switch the two.</p>
<p>In the meantime, back to your regularly scheduled <a href="https://pilch.me/2018/toddler-media-diet">children’s television</a> and <a href="https://pilch.me/2018/just-a-normal-mothers-day-brunch-playing-with-normal-toddler">Deadpool action figure</a> content.</p>

			 <p>The little man is starting to have strong opinions about what we play and read and listen to and watch. And while I have been able to <a href="https://pilch.me/2017/daft-punk-is-playing-at-my-house-is-playing-at">steer his tastes</a> in the past, he has started making his own picks too.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can steer those as well; he likes the newest Thor and Spider-Man movies, and we got him a 12-inch tall Hulk action figure that he treats like a baby doll.</p>
<p>Sometimes he misses big. He found and made us watch a Netflix show that appears to be just a GoPro mounted on the front of a passenger train through Norway. It is 7 hours long.</p>
<p>But his most recent pick is a winner. It’s called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculous:_Tales_of_Ladybug_%26_Cat_Noir"><em>Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir</em></a>, and it is basically a French CG mix of Sailor Moon and Spider-Man. It has the odd rhythm of a dubbed show, and he loves the repetitious transformation sequences. I appreciate a show like this being given some production value, and we can’t wait to start season 2 which dropped this week.</p>

  When last we checked in with Strokes and Voidz frontman Julian Casablancas, he was prying open your third eye in an interview with Vulture, during which he radiated the dismissive intellectual superiority of a college freshman who just discovered Howard Zinn. (Actual quote: “Oliver Stone’s The Untold History of the United States was another life-changer. That book is kind of like Howard Zinn. It’s all kind of snowballed, and now I feel like things are crystal clear to me, so I’m going to be clearer.”)

  If there’s one thing I’ve learned as a seasoned consumer of all things horror, it’s that situations are rarely as innocent as they seem. Dolls will spring to life and kill you. That big, beautiful house you got for a steal is haunted. You know how it goes. I let my guard down with Stardew Valley. “A gentle farming sim,” they said. “Get married and grow some artichokes, it’s so relaxing.” I should have trusted my instincts. As my artichokes grew, so too grew the terror.

<p>🔗: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/united-states-files-civil-action-forfeit-thousands-ancient-iraqi-artifacts-imported">United States Files Civil Action To Forfeit Thousands Of Ancient Iraqi Artifacts Imported By Hobby Lobby</a> | US Justice Dept</p>
<blockquote>
  Earlier today, the United States filed a civil complaint to forfeit thousands of cuneiform tablets and clay bullae. As alleged in the complaint, these ancient clay artifacts originated in the area of modern-day Iraq and were smuggled into the United States through the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, contrary to federal law. Packages containing the artifacts were shipped to Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (“Hobby Lobby”), a nationwide arts-and-crafts retailer based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and two of Hobby Lobby’s corporate affiliates.

			 <p>Being a parent is scary. Starting from essentially a blank slate, you are required to take a new human life, keep it alive, and teach it to function in society. Before #fatherhood, I never considered the now-daunting concept of teaching someone with a 50-75 word vocabulary how to use a toilet.</p>
<p>But there is a reason people do it, outside of Darwinian survival. That fear and self-doubt is the entry fee for some of the most rewarding experiences I can think of. Kids pick up things you don’t, or that you demonstrate unintentionally. And they know what they like, and form these opinions far earlier than I initially expected.</p>
<p>So when our toddler asked unprompted to play “my house” during dinner, my heart exploded with joy. Usually, song requests in our house involve wheels on buses, or rain going away, or some variation on a standard that stars Elmo. But during our drive-time commute dance parties, I control the radio. And I understood immediately that this request was for <em>Daft Punk Is Playing At My House</em>, the first track from the eponymous debut of LCD Soundsystem. The seed is now taking root.</p>
<p>So I want to thank James Murphy for teaching my son how to say the following words and phrases:</p>
<ul>
    <li>huh-OW-OW! (the open)</li>
    <li>my house</li>
    <li>ropes</li>
    <li>cases</li>
    <li>garage</li>
    <li>set them up (ooo ooo ye-ah)</li>
    <li>SOLO!</li>
    <li>let them go!</li>
    <li>DOWN-TOWN</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
</ul>
<p>If you would like to celebrate with me, here is a link to the album version:</p>

			 <p>What a year it has been. Personally, 2016 was pretty good. Our child is now walking and talking constantly, mostly about Thomas the Tank Engine<sup><a id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Some of my brothers got married (one literal, two figurative). I developed a fairly consistent <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/bullet-journaling">note-taking habit</a>, first with <a href="https://workflowy.com/invite/ff8dcef.lnx">Workflowy</a> and then with some <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/">Field Notes</a>. Probably worth its own post at a later date.</p>
<p>Having a toddler means I don’t get out as much as I used to, so my Official Dad Best-Of–2016 awards go to Deadpool, the new Ghostbusters, and the newest season of The Venture Brothers. Rogue One was also pretty good.</p>

<p>Congratulations to white people. You have proven your point, and we must all live with the consequences. I believe it was Maya Angelou that said “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”</p>
<p>Condolences to Secretary Clinton on a hard fought campaign.

<p>Shout out to the electoral college for exposing our expertly rigged system, identified by the GOP president-elect. I bet this is one of the first things he addresses when taking office.</p>
<p>Shout out to Antonin Scalia for gutting the Voting Rights Act and then dying, steering the boat towards and then tripling the size of the iceberg.

<p>Congratulations to our future presidential cabinet.

I am sure you all will have our best interests in mind.</p>
<p>Apologies to folks who are not straight white men, whom this will affect disproportionately, as it always has. I will try to be here for you, but if it is too much, I hear Vancouver is lovely.</p>
<p>Shout out to the Chicago Cubs, for siphoning off the extremely limited supply of karma for the year 2016, and taking an advance on the next 4 years.</p>
<p>As always, all glory to Mother Russia.</p>

			 <p>So you want to learn more about the encryption debate.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup> Well, take a knee, gang, its #storytime.</p>
<p>Flash back 10 years ago. No one gave a shit about cybersecurity unless you were in China or a ghostwritten Tom Clancy novel. Then, as people started using networked services in more places, the <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/" rel="nofollow">information leaks</a> began. It was still not an issue for the government (particularly, law enforcement), because useful data was just as accessible to them as it was to nefarious agents, like hackers or Facebook.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Snowden leaks began to paint a picture of just how much our own security agencies relied on cybersecurity weakness in their day-to-day operations. Snowden had trouble finding a journalist who could figure out how to use PGP to read his heavily encrypted messages to disseminate this information.</p>
<p>The leaked information made Silicon Valley companies <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131106/00235225143/pissed-off-google-security-guys-issue-fu-to-nsa-announce-data-center-traffic-now-encrypted.shtml" rel="nofollow">very angry</a>. So they began to encrypt transmissions between their data centers, as well as building it into their email, messaging, and mobile operating systems.</p>
<p>Now, encryption is just lots of math. Ever watch a movie about code breakers in WWII? Encryption. The only difference now is that common computers can do a lot more math in a short amount of time. But before this point, it was never viewed as particularly important to consumer software.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. In the same way that a gun is an offensive weapon, encryption is a defensive weapon. It protects your information from prying eyes, whomever that may be.</p>
<p>So now law enforcement has a problem. This technology is widely available, even to enemies of the state. Their proposed solution is to break it. Or to put it in their words, make it work for some and not for others. Kind of like how if you point a gun at something or someone you like, it will not fire. Because it only works in certain situations.</p>
<p>This is obviously a farce. As the old argument goes, if we outlaw guns, only law breakers will have guns. Since enemies of the state are not likely to stop using encrypted communication if it is outlawed, the only people without it will be law-abiding citizens. Effectively the exact opposite of the stated goal.</p>
<p>Remember this when some idiot presidential candidate<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup> tries to tell you how encryption is bad because terrorists are bad. The only benefit of outlawing encryption is to spy on you.</p>

  With Sepp Blatter (a pretty funny name in its own right) on his way out, the FIFA presidency is wide open. The rogues’ gallery of candidates are already positioning themselves—human rights groups accuse one potential frontrunner, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, of literally snitching on athletes who took part in pro-democracy demonstrations in the Arab Spring, leading them to be rounded up and tortured. It’s one of those laugh-to-keep-from-crying elections.

			 <p>(This was meant to be a brief reply to <a href="http://werd.io/2015/untestable-unsafe-and-on-the-freeway-why-cars-need-to" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this post</a>, but it ballooned into a post all its own.)</p>
<p>Open source automotive software makes sense on paper. I am all for it, even though it would obviate my employment as a test engineer for an automotive supplier. So let me tell you why it won’t happen.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Automotive manufacturers do not understand open source. They only see the liability, not the potential. If anything happens in the field requiring a recall, they are on the hook anyway. So they assume they should control the whole process and develop everything themselves from scratch. I’m not entirely sure some of them understand software itself, as evidenced by <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/dmca-ownership-john-deere/">John Deere presuming ownership over the software in their tractors</a>.</li>
    <li>Who would test this open source software (besides the manufacturer)? With web software, you can spin up a remote server on a cheap laptop and you are off and running, in relatively little time, at low cost. With automotive software, the platform costs are at least 5 figures, not to mention the specialized tools to upgrade the software of the various components. It is a much larger barrier to entry for third-party testing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I agree in principle that it would be a good idea. But it will never happen unless lawmakers force it to, and they do not have a great sense of open source software either. Of course, it will be interesting to see if traditional software companies (Google and Apple) will bring this mentality whey they enter the space in a few years time.</p>

			 <p>Dear Cheryl<a class="footnote" style="font-size: 1rem;" title="See footnote" href="#fn-name"><sup>1</sup></a> (my <a href="http://pilch.me/2014/dear-nsa-angel">NSA angel</a>),</p>
<p>Hi there. I have been reading (but you knew that) about the latest cycle of ad blocking, and how it will be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">end of advertising/journalism/the internet</a> as we know it<a class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-verge"><sup>2</sup></a>. It is fun to remember how pop-up blocking was also the end of internet advertising as we knew it!</p>
<p>Anyways, my favorite piece to come out of all this is <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm">a talk transcript by the head of Pinboard</a>.<a class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-least"><sup>3</sup></a> I encourage you to read it yourself, but here are some choice pull-quotes.</p>
<p>On ad morals:</p>
<blockquote>The ad networks’ name for this robotic deception is ‘ad fraud’ or ‘click fraud’. (Advertisers like to use moralizing language when their money starts to flow in the wrong direction. Tricking people into watching ads is good; being tricked into showing ads to automated traffic is evil.)</blockquote>
<p>On <a class="p-category" href="https://pilch.me/categories/internet" rel="tag">#internet</a> regulation:</p>
<blockquote>When I flew over to give this talk, I wasn’t worried about my plane falling out of the sky. Eighty years of effective technical regulation (and massive penalties for fraud) have made commercial aviation the safest form of transportation in the world.</blockquote>
<p>On smart refrigerators:</p>
<blockquote>Samsung recently got in hot water with their smart refrigerator. Because it failed to validate SSL certificates, the fridge would leak your Gmail credentials (used by its little calendar) to anyone who asked it. All I wanted was some ice, and instead my email got hacked.</blockquote>
<p>On living in San Francisco:</p>
<blockquote>You wouldn’t hire a gardener whose houseplants were all dead. But we expect that people will trust us to reinvent their world with software even though we can’t make our own city livable.</blockquote>
<p>Seriously, it is ten minutes of reading well spent.</p>
<p>Have a great day,
Craig</p>

			 <p>Dear Ernesto (my <a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="http://pilch.me/2014/dear-nsa-angel">NSA angel</a>),</p>
<p>We haven’t chatted (directly) in a while. How are things? Last I heard, you had the director of the FBI complaining about encryption <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/us/politics/apple-and-other-tech-companies-tangle-with-us-over-access-to-data.html">making his job harder</a>. Have you guys found the abominable Snowden<sup><a id="fnref-1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> yet?</p>
<p>Anyways, I am writing you today about the NSA’s <a href="http://deadspin.com/bombshell-espn-report-the-patriots-were-huge-cheaters-1729286402">Foxboro branch</a>. I did enjoy the <a class="p-category" href="https://pilch.me/categories/NFL" rel="tag">#NFL</a> shitting the bed in court last week over Ballghazi<sup><a id="fnref-2" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>, but this lends the internal power struggle some context. But what do I know, I am probably just a “<a href="http://grantland.com/the-triangle/nfl-deflategate-sports-media-roger-goodell-tom-brady-new-england-patriots/">butthurt Colts fan</a>.”</p>
<p>Also, it is hilarious that even after all this comes to light, they are still <a href="http://deadspin.com/what-exactly-happened-with-the-steelers-headsets-1730005682">jamming signals</a> in opposing teams’ headsets. Did you guys give them the tip to use their own game broadcast? I bet your style is more classic-rock-Van-Halen-Not-Van-Haggar signal interference.</p>

			 <p>I have been trying to not write about our house while it is on the market<sup><a id="fnref-house" class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-house">1</a></sup>, but I need to record this for posterity.</p>
<p>We have an old house, and last night, for the second time this year, a bat has made its way in while the house is locked up at night. Play-by-play:</p>
<p>Jessie (hereafter referred to as “<em>My Wife</em>“, in a Borat voice) goes to the kitchen for a glass of water around 2:30am, and sees a bat (hereafter referred to as Benoit) hanging on a window shade. I prepare for bat battle, and Benoit flies up and down our staircase for a bit. Benoit returns to the bathroom where we believe he entered, where he is promptly shut in, and My Wife and I return to our bedroom to regroup. Animal control is called, but “they don’t deal with that kind of thing<sup><a id="fnref-animal" class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-animal">2</a></sup>.” They end up getting a police man dispatched to our house (Officer Tinslow, who was really cool about it all). Benoit is now nowhere to be found (obvs), and we assume it has gone back into the wall or wherever. Flash forward to morning diaper change for Jack, when Benoit is found hanging on the drapes right next to the changing table in the nursery. He is not-very-quickly dispatched out that window, and is terrible at gaining altitude when flying in circles.</p>
<p>Some stray observations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bats are ten million percent easier to deal with in daylight. They do pretty much the same things, but you can see it. They seem smaller.</li>
    <li>As I said, this is the second time this happened. The first time, My Wife was pregnant, and this time is right before trying to sell/rent out our house.</li>
    <li>I kept thinking about the Louis CK bit from his last special about calling animal control, where they say they have a guy for that but they go to extraordinary lengths not to call him “the bat man.”</li>

			 <p>It is the DMZ week between the two major developer conferences of the year, <a class="p-category" href="https://pilch.me/categories/Google" rel="tag">#Google</a> I/O and Appple’s WWDC. Shots were fired by Google in the form of free and unlimited photo storage and an omnipresent search assistant for its upcoming OS update. <a class="p-category" href="https://pilch.me/categories/Apple" rel="tag">#Apple</a> fans have already begun <a title="Marco Arment: Why Not Google?" href="http://www.marco.org/2015/05/29/why-not-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflexively</a> <a title="Giving Up On Google" href="http://www.imore.com/giving-up-on-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asserting</a> that “Google ain’t no thing”:</p>
<blockquote>Everything has a price. With Apple, you typically pay them money, and they sell you premium products and services in return. That type of cost and relationship is easy to understand.
With Google, you typically pay them attention and data, and they give you free or cheap products and services in return. That cost and relationship is harder to understand.</blockquote>
<p>First of all, no, it is not hard to understand. For decades if not longer, services have used advertising to mitigate cost to the user. Ever listened to a radio, or read a newspaper, or received junk mail?</p>
<p>Second (and more nitpicky), you would be hard pressed to find anyone else making the argument for Apple offering users more choice. I am running a custom launcher, a third-party SMS client, and readily switch between three different browsers depending on my use cases. Ever tried that on iOS? <em>/android-troll</em></p>
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook even <a title="Apple CEO Tim Cook Delivers Blistering Speech on Encryption, Privacy" href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/apples-tim-cook-delivers-blistering-speech-on-encryption-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joined in</a>:</p>
<blockquote>“We believe the customer should be in control of their own information. You might like these so-called free services, but we don’t think they’re worth having your email, your search history and now even your family photos data mined and sold off for god knows what advertising purpose. And we think some day, customers will see this for what it is.”</blockquote>
<p>The first takeaway from this is that the Apple camp is placing a priority on <a class="p-category" href="https://pilch.me/categories/privacy" rel="tag">#privacy</a> while at the same time knocking “so-called free services” down a peg. This implies that privacy is only available to those who can afford it. This sentiment is much larger moral hazard than allowing tailored advertising to subsidize service.</p>
<p>The most important takeaway, however, is that this sentiment <a title="Mathew Ingram on Fortune" href="https://fortune.com/2015/06/03/tim-cook-apple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could turn into Apple’s Waterloo</a> if they don’t make some major improvements to their services. Google Photos has long been superior to iPhoto, only to be hamstrung by its dependence on Google’s misunderstood social network. Google solved that problem this year by separating them. Apple needs to give people a reason to pay out the nose for their competing product besides “hey, we won’t check out your pictures.”</p>
<p>Google offers value in exchange for information, which is why they are seen as a pinnacle of innovation. Apple offers value in exchange for cold hard cash, which is why they are seen as a walled garden surrounding a mountain of cash. Hopefully Apple’s private #cloud will open up and rain some new ideas on WWDC this year, instead of nude photos of celebrities. <em>/terrible-apple-troll-pun</em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Dear Governor Pence,</p>
<p><a class="p-category" href="https://pilch.me/categories/Indiana" rel="tag">#Indiana</a> has not been doing great in the media lately. First <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation">Pawnee had to merge with Eagleton</a><a id="fnref-parks" class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-parks"><sup>1</sup></a>, then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbreakable_Kimmy_Schmidt#Premise">the Mole Women emerged</a> from Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne’s bunker.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I would be glad to have those issues. They are preferable to the reality of transitioning from an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/30/how-an-hiv-outbreak-hit-rural-indiana-and-why-we-should-be-paying-attention/">HIV outbreak</a> to <a href="http://circanews.com/news/states-pass-religious-freedom-bills">legalizing discrimination</a> by religious organizations.</p>
<p>There is no getting around it – this is about discrimination. No matter how many times you tell us it is not, you also won’t just say you are against the discrimination of LGBT people. Pretty sure <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/2015/03/29/only-2-things-know-out-mike-pences-dissembling-interview">Stephanopolous is not known for hard-hitting journalism</a>, Mike. He was putting a softball on a tee for you, and you struck out.</p>
<p>Can you think of another reason a business would need “free exercise of religion”? Or that it would need to use that new-found religion as a defense in civil litigation? You have had several months to think of some examples. I’ve tried for a few days, and I am coming up empty. Maybe if it <a href="http://m.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/what-makes-indianas-religious-freedom-law-different/388997/?utm_source=SFFB">actually was the same as the federal RFRA</a>, which has been falsely claimed by several conservative news outlets, this would be easier.</p>
<p>I have been an Indiana resident since I was in elementary school. It makes me glad that this kind of skulduggery<a id="fnref-word" class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-word"><sup>2</sup></a> is coming to light, because there is always the small hope that the attention will help the problem. Now the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/pro-discrimination-religious-freedom-laws-are-dangerous-to-america/2015/03/29/bdb4ce9e-d66d-11e4-ba28-f2a685dc7f89_story.html">CEO of the richest company in America</a>, Parks and Rec’s own <a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Offerman/status/582707458683990016">Nick Offerman</a> (and <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/wilco-exercises-its-religious-freedom-not-play-ind-217266">Jeff Tweedy</a>), and <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q1/purdue-issues-statement-regarding-religious-freedom-restoration-act.html">your predecessor</a> are all throwing you under the bus. I know if there is one thing you guys like more than religion, it is capitalism.</p>
<p>But if the past is any indicator, things probably won’t change. I’m not sure if it is the cause or the effect, but smart, (even mildly) progressive people have been leaving the state for decades. Little, trying-to-be-subtle moves like this are the reason. This policy is only <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/news/indiana-needs-investment-not-abandonment-from-tech-leaders">driving more people out of the economic ghost town</a> that is (northern) Indiana.</p>
<p>Please don’t make us form a religion<a id="fnref-religion" class="footnote" title="See footnote" href="#fn-religion"><sup>3</sup></a> and sue you, which we are now allowed to do under your law, which <a href="https://inadvancesheet.wordpress.com/2015/03/27/the-indiana-religious-freedom-restoration-act-an-analysis-of-its-controversy/">does not define what a religion is</a>.</p>
<p>Good luck with reelection,

			 <p>Moving the blog to <a title="Known" href="http://withknown.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Known</a> has been in the back of my mind <a title="The Indie Web" href="https://pilch.me/2014/10/09/the-indie-web/">for a while now</a>, so I finally pulled the trigger. This has been a fun weekend project, now spilling into Tuesday. WordPress maintenance has become too cumbersome for my needs, and Known has been a breath of fresh air. Some notes from my experience:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Invaluable installation instructions in the Known documentation, as well as <a title="Known install notes" href="http://bmann.ca/2014/known-install-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The only issue I kept having was where to place the uploads directory, and how to point to it.</li>
    <li>Really, reeealy looking forward to importing my old blog content here. I know that WordPress import is on the horizon, and I forsee it bringing a large influx of personal sites to their hosted service.</li>
    <li>I love that the <a class="p-category" href="https://pilch.me/categories/indieweb/" rel="tag">#indieweb</a> functionality works out of the box.</li>
    <li>Chrome handles it very well on Android, but I need to play around with it more to figure out how to reply. Almost needs to be its own app…</li>
    <li>Facebook thinks I am a robot when I try to setup POSSE here, even after I answer a captcha and verify my mobile phone. So they don’t get to see any of these posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have not written many posts lately, as evidenced by my WordPress page (currently at <a title="pilchernet" href="http://pilchernet.com">pilchernet.com</a>). Hopefully this refresh will kickstart some creativity.</p>

			 <p>I have been trying to figure out why I felt bad about this, and I&rsquo;m glad someone else could articulate it for me. I remember laughing so hard my eyes teared up at one of his CBB bits (which probably wasn&rsquo;t even funny, which is also why I was laughing). Even the picture in the article (&ldquo;great dog name: Bark Obama&rdquo;) made me chuckle. I was looking forward to his work after Parks and Recreation. Tragic.</p>

<p>In the words of ZODIAC_MF, this show is NOT OPTIONAL. Although the guide does miss a couple of my favorite season 2 episodes, &ldquo;Love Bheits&rdquo; and &ldquo;Showdown at Cremation Creek.&rdquo; Really looking forward to the space special.</p>

<blockquote>In many ways, Gamergate is an almost perfect closed-bottle ecosystem of bad internet tics and shoddy debating tactics. Bringing together the grievances of video game fans, self-appointed specialists in journalism ethics, and dedicated misogynists, it's captured an especially broad phylum of trolls and built the sort of structure you'd expect to see if, say, you'd asked the old Fires of Heaven message boards to swing a Senate seat. It's a fascinating glimpse of the future of grievance politics as they will be carried out by people who grew up online.</blockquote>

<p class="graf--p">If you have a kid, why <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">not</em> run experiments on them? It’s like running experiments on a little clone of yourself! And almost always probably legal.</p>
<p class="graf--p">It’s disappointing how many people have children and miss this golden opportunity, usually waiting until they’re in their teens to start playing mindgames with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The day after "Endless Appetizers" was announced, I went to TGI Friday's in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sheepshead Bay. I wanted to challenge the hubris of a company co-opting the infinite for a marketing gimmick. I wanted to demand accountability from copywriters.</p>
<p>I wanted to call their bluff and eat appetizers until they kicked me out, to seek the limit of this supposedly limitless publicity stunt.</p>
<p>I soon learned the limit does not exist.</p>

Settling a Great Pokémon Debate with Science</a> - Scientific American</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="postTitle">But no matter what my relationship to Pokémon is now, I can’t deny that it was one of the driving forces in my nerdy life. And like any fanboy or girl who has ever played the original games, Pokémon was singular in that it provided me the first life-altering choice in my young life: Which of the starting Pokémon—Squirtle, Charmander, or Bulbasaur—should I pick? It felt like a digital “Sophie’s Choice,” with any decision rendering two Pokémon forever un-catchable, destined to be used against me by my rival.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="title">...We can’t all be grand visionaries. We can’t all be Picassos. We want to make our business, make our art, sell it, make some money, raise a family, and try to be happy. My feeling, based on my own experience, is that aiming for grandiosity is the fastest route to failure. For every Mark Zuckerberg, there are 1000 Jack Zuckermans. Who is Jack Zuckerman? I have no idea. That’s my point. If you’re Jack Zuckerman and you’re reading this, I apologize. You aimed for the stars and missed. Your reentry into the atmosphere involved a broken heat shield, and you burned to a crisp by the time you hit the ocean. Now we have no idea who you are.</p>

<p class="title"><a title="Programming Sucks" href="http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks" target="_blank">Programming Sucks</a> - Peter Welch</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="title">You can't restart the internet. Trillions of dollars depend on a rickety cobweb of unofficial agreements and "good enough for now" code with comments like "TODO: FIX THIS IT'S A REALLY DANGEROUS HACK BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG" that were written ten years ago. I haven't even mentioned the legions of people attacking various parts of the internet for espionage and profit or because they're bored. Ever heard of 4chan? 4chan might destroy your life and business because they decided they didn't like you for an afternoon, and we don't even worry about 4chan because another nuke doesn't make that much difference in a nuclear winter.</p>

			 <p>We live in exciting, sometimes terrifying times. It has become fashionable to carry a device on your person at all times with more computing power than NASA&rsquo;s Apollo command center. Products raise millions of dollars to essentially communicate with that smart device from several feet away. The most popular uses of of these mobile devices are to shoot round birds with a slingshot at makeshift towers built by pigs, and to broadcast any minute detail that pops up in the ol&rsquo; brain bucket. Broad new horizons.</p>
<p>However, users of these devices (and the services they enable) bring with them horizons that are neither broad nor new. Certain subcultures, previously ignored and subsequently rendered powerless, now have the means to broadcast globally and connect like-minded individuals regardless of geographic location. This message amplification has the ability to force society to progress with great strides, as with the LGBT community. But for some reason, the net-positive effect does not happen with everyone. The most recent instance of this is Gamergate.</p>
<p>In years past, I might have identified myself as a gamer. In the sense that &ldquo;I enjoy and often play video games in my free time&rdquo;, it is an accurate descriptor to this day. After the past few months, I would be reluctant to identify myself this way. If you have successfully avoided any Gamergate news up to this point, good on you. Keep it up. If you feel like being sad about life, read this summary <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/gamergate-about-media-ethics-or-harassing-women-harassment-data-show-279736">from Newsweek</a> with actual Twitter statistics, or this <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844">in-depth summary</a> about the implications of this type of movement.</p>
<p>Upon further research, this seems like a deeper cultural issue, unrelated to gaming. I would say it is an American issue, but it is likely present elsewhere too. Kathy Sierra, a prominent tech figure, has now had to essentially <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/12/4693710/the-end-of-kindness-weev-and-the-cult-of-the-angry-young-man">leave the internet</a> for the <a href="http://seriouspony.com/trouble-at-the-koolaid-point">second time</a> in less than 10 years. Before that, several private personal pictures of celebrities were leaked, of which there was a single male (and he was collateral damage, as he was dating one of the targeted female celebrities). Even before that, dumb old white guys were talking (seemingly sincerely) about &ldquo;legitimate rape&rdquo; in congressional election coverage. The megaphone created by our newly-connected society seems to have pretty terrible opinions about women on an alarmingly consistent basis.</p>
<p>TL;DR The only way I know how to help is to write about it. I will be a parent soon. It scares me to think that the difficulty of that kid&rsquo;s life will be so greatly affected by a single genetic coin-toss.</p>

			 <p>Microsoft Office makes people worse at software.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I work with engineers - people that know their way around power electronics and embedded software<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. But somehow, no one seems to know how version control works. I lay the blame squarely at the feet of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>In my first C programming class, we only received grades on work that we checked in using the version control software<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It was a revelation to me, at the time, that there existed a way to collaborate on software (or any other electronic documents). This is likely because I did most of my document editing in high school in - what else - Microsoft Word.</p>
<p>So why has this revelation failed to bubble up to the (too) many companies with Microsoft enterprise agreements? Sure, my first introduction was via the command line, but Dropbox and Google Docs have shown it can be done in a user-friendly GUI. I constantly see coworkers go to the not-so-great length of changing a date in the document title and think &ldquo;Boom - new version.&rdquo; Or, even better - send out a document for several people to edit, who return their input as &ldquo;Title - MM/DD/YY - Employee Initials&rdquo;. It seems crazy that 1.) no one has thought &ldquo;we should think of a better engineered solution to this&rdquo;, and then 2.) &ldquo;oh wait, IT ALREADY EXISTS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though it is not built into Office directly, I know version control is available for it now. I have even used it! Microsoft&rsquo;s sort-of-cloud solution, Sharepoint, has version control and document check-out baked right in. It is buried in some context menu somewhere (proving my conspiracy theory that MS does not want you to use it), but it is there. Yet somehow we still create an Archive folder with all the previous, dated documents. It is a waste of storage space, a huge time suck, and can be extremely confusing.</p>
<p>I write this both as an admonishment for the workflows at my company, and as an acknowledgement that I am falling for it too. I have started to do this, mostly because my colleagues do, even though I know it is a terrible habit. The first step is admitting you have a problem. I look forward to apologizing to all the spreadsheets I have wronged in the past.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t get me started on the crazy things people put into Excel.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

			 <p>I have been <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/26/how-to-share-online/">griping</a> about <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/03/02/facebook-break/">leaving</a> <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/04/05/facebook-break-part/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/12/16/the-year-of-the-blog/">owning my data</a> for a while now, but I may have finally found a solution.</p>
<p>The indie web, its called. Made up of the people who got tired of talking about these concepts and decided to start doing something about them.</p>
<p>I first heard about them on one of my weekly must-hear podcasts, In Beta (<a href="http://5by5.tv/inbeta/90">episode 90</a>). Then a guest on another webcast I enjoy regularly - <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google/241">This Week in Google #241</a> - brought it up near the end. (TWiG actually just dedicated most of an episode to it - <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google/266">#266</a>.)</p>
<p>I always viewed blogging (at least <em>my</em> blog) as a spot for thoughts that skewed toward longform writing, that could not be fleshed out in a short snippet. The indie web, however, encourages tweet-length thoughts as well as longer posts, which can then be syndicated to whatever social network you choose. The point is to not keep those thoughts siloed somewhere that may eventually shut down or change their policies, but to control your online identity, on your own terms. You can build your own tools, or you can browse <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com">the IndieWeb site</a> to find something pre-built to use on your site.</p>
<p>But how will people see these posts if they are on Facebook or Twitter? Well, they thought of that too. POSSE stands for Post (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. By syndicating, your non-IndieWeb friends will still get to see what you are up to. And using the webmention protocol, comments and replies will be pulled back into your own site as well.</p>
<p>If you are feeling less brave, one of the higher-profile indie web tools just launched a beta. It is called <a href="http://www.withknown.com">Known</a>, and it has been <a href="http://pilch.withknown.com">treating me well</a> so far. I look forward to their hosted/beta service adding a Wordpress plugin. But if I did my work right, you should see my Known post about this article down below.</p>
<p>TL;DR: if you see anything oddly formatted posts on my site or one of my social profiles, it is probably an attempt at implementing one of the Indie Web projects. Maybe if you are getting wary of Facebook and you&rsquo;re looking for a technically-inclined side project, you should check it out too.</p>

<p>I am a Transformers fan.</p>
<p>It takes a lot to admit that anymore. That admission comes with a lot more baggage now than it did 10 years ago. It is a bit like being a Los Angeles Clippers fan; things started to get pretty good, but then the guy in charge is super racist<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and is kind of mad that people found out about that and goddammit he&rsquo;s going to take everyone down with him.</p>
<p>My allegiances lie firmly with Hasbro, who I assume ghostwrote the current movie, as they have since the beginning. I own numerous shape-changing action figures, and will continue to buy them<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> because secretly I am a nine year old with no self control. Even my USB drive is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transformer-USB-Flash-Memory-Drive/dp/B004CI906G">Ravage</a> (a knock off, but <a href="https://plus.google.com/+CraigPilcher/posts/WQxGkS6RpXa">still</a>).</p>
<p>I write all this to frame my review of <em>Transfomers 4: Hey, Mark Wahlberg! Right?</em><sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> It is, in the words of Charles Barkley, T-R-B-L turrible.</p>
<p>(Edit: I wrote this in the few days following the theatrical release, but haven&rsquo;t had time to publish until now. The review holds up, but some of the references would have made more sense in June. Deal with it lol)</p>
<p>I rewatched the third one, because a) I am a glutton for punishment, b) I&rsquo;ve already said I am a Transformers fan, and thus own all the movies, and c) because I wanted to confirm the my theory that they are steadily getting worse. I think it holds.</p>
<p>The first one had just enough of Spielberg&rsquo;s touch to be pretty good. The second one was critically panned, and probably rightfully so, so several actors and writers jumped ship. Seemingly the only goal of the third movie was &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be actively racist again&rdquo;, which they accomplished by killing of Ken Jeong (best character in the movie) before they could do any damage. And for the fourth, they basically took a cookie cutter to the third movie and said LaBeouf, Turturro, Jeong, Patrick Dempsey ==&gt; Wahlberg, Tucci, TJ Miller, Kelsey Grammer<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. And DINOSAURS!</p>
<p>Basically, the movie plot can be boiled down to <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/transformers-logical-sense/">this quote</a>, from the writer of the goddamn movie:</p>
<blockquote>When you’re talking about aliens, robotic machines which disguise themselves as vehicles and animals, you start to make your peace with the idea that logical sense doesn’t have to be the be-all, end-all.</blockquote>
<p>Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but expanding it to include plot and character development is another. &ldquo;Making the robots the main characters? Allowing natural human interaction? Using the dinosaur robots before the last 15 minutes of a near-three-hour film? Nah, those would make logical sense. Oh, a samurai that transforms into a Bugatti Veyron AND a helicopter? Now you have something. Get Ken Watanabe on the phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My only recourse is to not pay to see the film (which I already did). I can only sit back and watch Michael Bay ruin <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1291150/?ref_=nm_flmg_prd_3">the rest of my childhood</a>. So, Michael, if you are reading this: STAY AWAY FROM CAPTAIN PLANET. NO. STOP IT.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn1">Michael Bay is not super racist. I'm not saying that. Whoever wrote <a href="http://youtu.be/QQxS2BsHQfo">these jackasses</a>, or Ken Watanabe's lines in the new film, is <em>secretly</em> racist. Not super racist. <a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">↩</a>

<p>These things are all kind of cool, but it is dumb to assume that Apple will &ldquo;bowl over&rdquo; its competition by, essentially, osmosis. All the things will soon be 5.15-inch metal-rimmed slabs. I, for one, welcome our new robot overlords.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://pilch.me/2014/05/14/productivity-in-the-age-of/">Flip-flopping</a> yet again, I found another organization method to try out called the <a href="http://www.bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>. This one is decidedly analog, and the only major commitment is carrying around a notebook.</p>
<p>The idea is to record everything as a bullet point. Tasks get checkboxes, events get circles, and everything is gets a standard bullet. It seems simple enough, but there are some benefits over digital.</p>
<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0">
<li>The act of writing something down makes you more likely to remember it. </li>
<li>It forces you to be constantly reviewing<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> your notes, which keeps them fresh in your mind. </li>
<li>It keeps you mindful about what you record. I still type faster than I write, so I am not going to take the time to record something in the journal that will have little value.</li>
<li>You have to stick with it. With the digital services, I could jump back and forth between them while testing them out. I am in this Bullet Journal thing until I run out of pages in my notebook, which could take several months.</li>
</ul>
<p>So far it is working well. I did need to upgrade to a larger notebook; I thought the 3.5 x 5.5 inch one would do, but it is hard to fit everything in. Evernote is already suited for this, with its own notebooks and OCR capability, so my technology geek cred is still relatively intact I think. (And I fist tried it with <a href="https://medium.com/@amirmasoudabdol/workflowy-journal-d33405065d64">Workflowy</a>, which worked briefly but became a little unwieldy). If you are a habitual note taker, I recommend giving this method a shot.</p>

			 <p>The phone du jour is the HTC One M8, and I am a phone connoisseur. My <a title="To Jump or not to Jump" href="https://pilch.me/2014/04/30/to-jump-or-not-to/">JUMP-grade</a> came up, and I had to pull the trigger. The Nexus 5 was a fantastic phone, but it was lacking in a few areas: battery life, camera, and <a title="LG G2 Flash Review" href="https://pilch.me/2013/11/15/lg-g-flash-review/">tap to unlock</a>. So I pulled the trigger and have been using this beast for a few weeks. Here are my thoughts so far.</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTC makes a really pretty device. The Nexus is very utilitarian, which comes from prioritizing price over build quality. Samsung and LG focus on adding mostly-useless crap and letting their phones look like a Band-aid and a child's toy, respectively [see <a href="#update1">update</a>]. I would rather have brushed aluminum and front-facing speakers than a heart monitor and 4 different ways to unlock my device and take a screenshot simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Speaking of speakers, the BoomSound speakers on the One are amazing. Before, I was living in a world where cell phone speakers were just supposed to be low-quality and tinny. Not anymore.</li>
    <li>Blinkfeed is OK, I guess. If there were a way to add my own RSS feeds, it might be useful. Hopefully they will add this feature (or make it less complicated to find).</li>
    <li>Motion Launcher needs to be on all phones, from now on. It makes so much more sense than the side buttons.</li>
    <li>T-Mobile bloatware is dumber than Verizon bloatware. They offer you a 30 day trial for voicemail transcription, but only if you agree to pay $4 per month after that. All for something Google Voice does for free.</li>
    <li>The camera is pretty solid. The low resolution freaks people out, but it is as martphone, not a Nikon. Standard smartphone cameras don't take good pictures in low light, but this one does pretty well. The editing tools are great as well. The Duo Camera is just ok - it is not a necessity, but adds some editing options to close-up pictures:
<img class="wp-image-1281 size-large" src="https://pilch.micro.blog/uploads/2025/3ba96d5f42.jpg" alt="Charlie greets me" width="600" height="339">
<p> </li></p>
</ul>
<p>All in all, the HTC One M8 is a solid phone, and I would recommend it to anyone. It comes at a premium price, but it is the one Android phone available right now that has the looks, feel, and function of a premium device.</p>
<p id="update1">Update: LG announced the G3 while I was writing this, and it looks like a phone that an adult would use.</p>

			 <p>I am a flip-flopper. The newest thing is always best; the grass perpetually greener. It is why I just got a <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/04/30/to-jump-or-not-to/">new phone</a>, and why my employer using Windows XP (!!!) on all employee laptops until late last year drove me crazy.</p>
<p>In addition, my favorite form of procrastination is reading about new ways to do work. All the bases are covered - the illusion of work, thinking about work, theoretically improving future work - to feel productive without actually <em>being</em> productive. <a href="http://lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a> is the ESPN<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> of feeling productive, my main source of finding new ways to work (especially the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/how-i-work">How I Work</a> series).</p>
<p>This is most likely the reason that I cannot choose a to-do/note-taking/organizer program. There are so many, but I think I finally have it narrowed down to about 4.</p>
<p>My previous favorite was Workflowy, basically an infinite nested list. Todo.txt is the open-source nerd tool, which just uses a .txt file. Trello makes everything into a bulletin board with cards pinned on it, and Evernote does all the things, everywhere.</p>

<p>They all work great, but at slightly different things. Evernote would be the best option, with its ability to store photos. but most of its function comes from storage, not helping me to process that storage. I am still figuring that bit out, and will probably use one of the other tools to do it.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>My favorite right now is Trello. I tried it a year or so ago, and it seemed better suited for group projects. Now, they have a better mobile client, and the documentation is easier <a href="https://trello.com/b/nPNSBZjB/trello-resources">to find</a>. Also, the keyboard shortcuts<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> are great and make using it fun. I would highly recommend using one to sort out daily life. None of them will meet all your needs<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, but you can make them work together to hit all your bases.</p>

			 <p>I am a <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/10/31/phablet-couture-or-how-i/">gadget</a> <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/11/15/lg-g-flash-review/">enthusiast</a>, so when T-Mobile announced their <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/10/4511160/t-mobile-announces-jump-two-phone-upgrades-per-year-for-10-monthly">JUMP program</a> a year ago, it caught my attention. If you haven&rsquo;t heard of it, the program allows you to trade in your device after 6 months for a new one. It also offers insurance on the device. From the outside, it looks like a ripoff. Here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>A flagship phone will cost you around $650. If you get it through T-Mobile, you are paying $0 down and $27/month. JUMP costs $10/month, so after 6 months, you have paid $162 for the phone, and $60 for insurance<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. T-Mobile pays the difference, regardless of the condition, and you walk away with a new phone.</p>
<p>Doing this on your own will cost you $600-700 up front, plus the time to sell a device (and ship it to the buyer). And if it breaks in that 6 months, you are on the hook for repairs or a replacement.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> You may get slightly more than the 75%<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> of the price T-Mobile &ldquo;pays&rdquo; for it, but not enough to offset the streamlined transaction and insurance.</p>
<p>The real issue is whether it is prudent to upgrade a phone every 6 months. Probably not, but right now the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/25/5544642/htc-one-review-m8">HTC One</a> hits some checkmarks<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> that my Nexus 5 did not, and I&rsquo;ve already paid for the JUMP, so I am pulling that trigger as soon as I am eligible.</p>

Where&rsquo;s the heads up, buddy? I thought we were friends.</p>
<p>It sucks that it only takes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/10/technology/users-stark-reminder-as-web-grows-it-grows-less-secure.html?_r=0">one guy missing a couple lines of code</a> to totally undermine security on about half of the internet. I bet you guys wish you were that efficient. So did you have to change your passwords too? Probably not. Whatever proprietary security software you guys use would probably still be secure even if everyone&rsquo;s password is &ldquo;guest&rdquo;.</p>

			 <p>Dear Mike (my <a href="https://pilch.me/2014/02/12/dear-nsa-angel/">NSA angel</a>),</p>
<p>I hear you guys <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/4/5469316/government-sues-sprint-for-allegedly-overcharging-21-million-in-surveillance">got duped pretty bad by a major US telecom company</a>. I am having trouble picking a favorite part of this situation. Too many to choose from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Telecoms apparently overcharge everyone, even the federal government.</li>
    <li>The idea of suing those telecoms to get your money back is laughable when you substitute "average consumer" for "federal government."</li>
    <li>Sprint's network was not capable of adequate surveillance, from a technical standpoint. If you are planning something that will get you surveilled and you are smart enough to use a network that is too shitty to tap, you deserve to operate in secret.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is anyone in the right here? It&rsquo;s like corruption <em>Inception</em>. I know you can neither confirm or deny any of this<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but come on. We know it was you, Mike.</p>

<p>My cable company is <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/13/5407704/comcast-confirms-45-billion-acquisition-of-time-warner-cable">attempting to buy their closest competitor</a>. I know you and Comcast are bros on the DL, but your love is quite transparent to the public. Anyways, was this your idea? Vertical integration of data harvesting, now covering 37 of the top 40 markets in America. Solid strategy. I try to avoid conspiracy theories, but a surveillance state combined with this sounds like some Illuminati<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> shit.</p>
<p>Speaking of TV, how have you liked the new season of House of Cards so far<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>? Some solid digital espionage going on in the first few episodes, but through the FBI/Secret Service? Come on, we both know who the real <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=leetspeak">1337</a> h4XX0rs are.</p>
<p>So, listen, if any packages come to the house, could you put them inside the screen door for me? I don&rsquo;t get home until the evening, and I would prefer they weren&rsquo;t covered in snow. Also, weather machine? Is that a thing yet? Please get someone on that ASAP.</p>
<p>Thanks,

<p>Google&rsquo;s music app is pretty great, and when the All-Access part was released it seemed like the perfect complement to complete the service. In my opinion it is no longer doing what the All-Access part is meant to do - helping me discover new music. I guess in the most basic sense, I have heard some songs on there that I had not heard before (not memorable enough for me to bookmark them or add them to a playlist though).</p>
<p>The major feature of Google Music is that you can upload your own library of songs, but people forget that this is not part of the paid service; you can do this for free. Paying just adds the ability to play songs that you did not upload, and roll them into its sub par<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> radio stations. Regardless of whether I keep the All-Access service, the music locker facet is invaluable and the best implementation I have seen.</p>
<h4 id="dark-horse">Dark horse</h4>
<p>Spotify is probably the biggest player in this space right now (I admit I did not give it a lot of credit on the first draft of this post), but it seems like a mess. I still cannot figure out how to add songs to my library without putting them in a playlist. This must come from years of managing a large library, but I do not want to organize my collection this way. Their radio offering seemed just OK - I tried it again for this first time in months (my starred playlist station) and hit the same 2 albums 5 out of the first 6 plays (<em>The Suburbs</em> and <em>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</em>, but still).<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="also-ran">Also-ran</h4>
<p>Pandora is kind of in a different boat, but I have used it several times over the past year. The algorithmic muscle of Pandora is great but the idea has yet to be fully realized. The fact that it can only pull from a library of 900k tracks<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> limits its usefulness as a recommendation engine. The ads are a bit frequent, but not quite enough to warrant paying.</p>
<h4 id="and-the-winner-is...">And the winner is...</h4>
<p>Rdio seems like the front runner to me. It has many of the same top-flight features as the other two services, but with a little more attention to detail. The design is fantastic, and the organization is much more straight forward than Spotify. It feels much more social within the service than GMusic, but hitching to a Facebook account is optional rather than mandatory<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. The radio recommendations can be adjusted between &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; and &ldquo;adventurous,&rdquo; depending on what you feel like listening to.</p>
<p>There is one feature Rdio has that GMusic and Spotify definitely do not: the queue syncs between devices. This means when you start listening on another device, you are on the same song in your playlist or station. This detail by itself is nearly enough reason to switch.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> You can also mark items for download to your mobile device from the web player, which I know Google can&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>The only gripe I have seen about Rdio is that it does not advertise its bitrate. Spotify and Google stream at 320 kbps on wi-fi, and Pandora is something like 160 kbps unless you buy a subscription. My argument is that if I hear something that I like but is low quality (on terrestrial radio or over a cellular connection), I am going to purchase it in a high quality format (CD, FLAC, vinyl - audio quality is a rabbit hole in itself). Things that are in a low bit-rate that I don&rsquo;t need to hear again are not a problem. Moot point.</p>
<p>So there are my thousand-plus-word thoughts on the state of streaming music (Beats Music not included, because it is too new). TL;DR: Google Play&rsquo;s best feature does not require the paid version, and Rdio is the intuitive, good-looking underdog with a can&rsquo;t-lose attitude that wins my pick for best streaming music service available.</p>

    <li id="fn1">The second footnote of this link mentions Plex, and while they have a media server, it doesn't support some basic music player functions, like playlists. I am sure this will be remedied in the future, but until then it is behind all the rest of the services listed here. <a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">↩</a>
</li>
    <li id="fn2">Matching with Rdio requires WMP or iTunes, which sucks because I actively avoid both. I don't think Spotify is as strict on sources. <a href="#fnref2" rev="footnote">↩</a>
</li>
    <li id="fn3">This basically means no for Android. The only last.fm scrobblers I have tried read from the system audio player, which then catches all the podcasts I listen to as well. It would get the job done, but it is also really annoying. <a href="#fnref3" rev="footnote">↩</a>
</li>
    <li id="fn4">The quality of the radio is a function of the feedback you give it, and only gets better over time. It did get better, but the quality definitely plateaued much sooner than I would have liked. This could be a function of what I listened to on the service, but Rdio and Pandora are both still improving their suggestions in my opinion, with roughly the same amount of feedback. <a href="#fnref4" rev="footnote">↩</a>

    <li id="fn5">It does not help that their web player seems to be blocked at my place of employment. Desktop player is (or was) fine, but I have never successfully started their web player.  <a href="#fnref5" rev="footnote">↩</a>

    <li id="fn6">The largest library for comparison belongs to Spotify, which has over 20 million tracks. Google and Rdio are not far behind. <a href="#fnref6" rev="footnote">↩</a>

			 <p>One of my best friends is doing some awesome things in the Navy. Like, awesome enough that he can&rsquo;t really say what they are. My wife and I were talking about him a couple weeks ago and came to the realization that we have contacted him enough that we are well within the two or three degrees of separation required<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for NSA surveillance<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Since then, we have included occasional messages to our &ldquo;NSA angel&rdquo; in our everyday communication, to see if they come true or just to give some Quantico keyboard jockey a laugh. Thus far, our NSA angel has failed to predict the Super Bowl outcome<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> or chime in with the proper number of ibuprofen pills to treat inflammation.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Anyways, I haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time to write lately - just been a little busy<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. And the only people that knew about my NSA angel were my wife and I, our Navy friend<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, and our NSA angel (obviously). So I am making my NSA Angel letters their own <a href="https://pilch.me/categories/dear-nsa-angel/">category</a> in hopes to kickstart some writing. Please feel free to write some to your own NSA angel as well. I&rsquo;m sure they get bored reading about every detail of your life (some of which you probably don&rsquo;t even know yourself).</p>

These services are obviously all trying to do different things. Tumblr is more social and doesn’t do as well for longform posts. Wordpress is the everything box that doesn’t excel at anything. Scriptogram is as simple as a text file in your Dropbox. Svbtle is new and pretty but missing a couple of key features (for me, anyways).
<p>These two new ones have caught my eye, and if the one gets better looking or the other adds MultiMarkdown, pilchernet may have a new home.</p>

<h3>COOL ARTICLES I READ, PROBABLY THIS YEAR</h3>
<p><a href="http://gawker.com/on-smarm-1476594977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Smarm (Gawker)</a></p>
<blockquote>What is smarm, exactly? Smarm is a kind of performance—an assumption of the forms of seriousness, of virtue, of constructiveness, without the substance. Smarm is concerned with appropriateness and with tone. Smarm disapproves.
<p>Smarm would rather talk about anything other than smarm. Why, smarm asks, can&rsquo;t everyone just be nicer?</blockquote></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115726/period-our-simplest-punctuation-mark-has-become-sign-anger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Period is Pissed (The New Republic)</a></p>
<blockquote>The period was always the humblest of punctuation marks. Recently, however, it’s started getting angry. I’ve noticed it in my text messages and online chats, where people use the period not simply to conclude a sentence, but to announce “I am not happy about the sentence I just concluded.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>You've gone and done it. You've expressed a preference for a bourbon within earshot of another person. Little did you realize that arguing about bourbon is now our sixth most popular sport, behind arguing about "grape vs. grain" vodkas, parenting strategies, craft beers, workout regimens, and college football.</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/16/this-time-is-different/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Ready to Lose Your Job (TechCrunch)</a></p>
<blockquote>Kurzweil <a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims</a> that whenever technology hits a limit, “a paradigm shift (i.e., a fundamental change in the approach) occurs, which enables exponential growth to continue.” That’s not much more than a convenient article of faith. As Peter Thiel <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/278758/end-future-peter-thiel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">points out</a>, “technological progress has fallen short in many domains. Consider the most literal instance of non-acceleration: We are no longer moving faster. The centuries-long acceleration of travel speeds … reversed with the decommissioning of the Concorde in 2003.”</blockquote>

<span style="line-height:1.5;">My new year’s resolution for 2013 has been to write. Just, in general, write when you can. I enjoy experimenting with technology and software, so I thought a blog would do the trick. It has gone through several iterations, but this is where it has ended up.</span><sup id="footnote1"><a class="footnote" id="fnref:fruit" style="line-height:1.5;" title="See footnote" href="fruit">1</a></sup>

<div class="se-section-delimiter">

Blogging was the major internet trend in the early- to mid-2000s, which is why seemingly no one does it anymore and all the cool people broadcast their thoughts on their social network of choice. But there are several advantages to it that people forget about in the age of the like and the tweet. Blogging creates your own personal space on the web, free from <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20131025/facebook-wont-launch-video-ads-this-year/">advertisers devising new ways to use your own data</a> to push their product more effectively. If done correctly, you own the content you put out, and you can learn a lot of about web hosting and internet protocols if you so choose. I was only just starting, so I tried going the free route to see what I could find.
<h4 id="pressing-tumbling">Pressing & Tumbling</h4>
I started out with a <a href="http://craigwpilcher.wordpress.com">wordpress.com blog</a>. It had everything I needed to start writing, so I did. The community at wordpress.com is centered on writing, which was good encouragement. But once I started to get the hang of it, it seemed like there was a lot that the free account would not let me do. The open source <a href="https://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> is a powerful tool, and their free site gives you just enough of a taste to know you can do more. I still was not ready to fork over any money, so I packed up for the other major free ‘blogging’ tool on the web today, <a href="https://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>.
<p>I had started a <a href="http://craigpilcher.tumblr.com">Tumblr account</a> a while ago, but hadn’t used it much. I came back to compare features with my new Wordpress blog, and there was a lot to like. The site is very stylish and minimalist, which is kind of the opposite of Wordpress (unless you put a lot of work into it). It is easy to find a lot of interesting people on Tumblr, and the mobile app is great (better than Wordpress at the time). The combination was enough to keep me there for most of the year.</p>
<h4 id="ghosting">Ghosting</h4>
In late October, an episode of one of my must-listen podcasts focused on blogging (<a href="http://5by5.tv/inbeta/70">In Beta #70</a>), and it convinced me to try to build my own blog. I finally had a feel for the writing part, and I wanted to make a place of my own that didn’t end in ‘dot something dot com.’ The one that sounded the most interesting, <a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a>, had just launched to the public. I <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/11/13/hello-world/">registered my domain</a>, hacked around in my router settings, and started hosting it from my own laptop. This was obviously not an ideal situation, but I still wanted to experiment before venturing into the confusing world of web hosting services.
<p>The experience was enlightening. Ghost will soon be a great blogging platform, but for the technical layperson it is not there yet. I enjoy the minimalist approach, and they are still adding features, but there are bugs. I was not able to even upload a picture, a simple task on another framework. I could not nail down whether it was a bug in the code or a bug in my makeshift server settings. My laptop was also hosting my Plex server and kept getting kicked off the network in favor of my NAS, so I finally gave in and found a <a href="http://www.nosupportlinuxhosting.com/">cheap webhost</a>. Ghost is too resource intensive for shared hosting, so back to Wordpress I went.</p>
<h4 id="tools-and-takeaways">Tools and Takeaways</h4>
One of the major lessons I learned from all this is that formatting a post is much easier in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>. The native editor in Ghost offers Markdown support (which I miss), but the others have not added this (or have done it poorly). So, for the most part I composed posts with outside tools. <a href="https://draftin.com">Draft</a> has been my tool of choice, and I have been using it since its release. It supports Multimarkdown (footnotes and tables and such), and it also allows professionals to review your work for a small fee. Draft moved to a freemium model, and has started to really push for users to subscribe. Although the writing features are invaluable I don’t feel like I write enough to justify paying (is this a recurring theme?). Because of this, I have tried out some other writing tools recently. <a href="https://editorially.com">Editorially</a> and <a href="dillinger.io">Dillinger</a> are two good ones that I have found, but the best so far feature-wise is <a href="https://stackedit.io/#">StackEdit</a>.
<p>What else did I learn?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Writing can be very therapeutic. A blog is a good place for venting <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/10/02/wanna-get-away/">frustration</a> or <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/10/24/virtuous-circles-of-software/">righteous nerd anger</a>.</li>
	<li>I am apparently a cheapskate. I guess I did not know what I was doing, so going the free route made sense, but it did not hit me just how far I went to avoid spending money until writing this post.</li>
	<li>Open source is the way to go. The wide open nature of the web would not be nearly as wide if it were built on proprietary tools. You can almost always find an open source, (nearly-)free version of whatever tool you need.</li>
</ul>

			 <p><span style="line-height:1.5;">Due to a combination of horrible timing and a lack of my second and third choices</span><sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><span style="line-height:1.5;"> at the T-Mobile store</span><sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><span style="line-height:1.5;">, I have been using an LG G2 for about a week and a half. In that time I mostly just used it to search </span><em style="line-height:1.5;">&lsquo;Nexus 5 T-Mobile release date&rsquo;</em><span style="line-height:1.5;"> over and over again (finally </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5082000/nexus-5-tmobile-release-date-november-14-449">announced last Friday</a><span style="line-height:1.5;">), but I thought I should jot down some thoughts about this interim phone.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li>
<a href="http://www.lg.com/us/mobile-phones/g2#Knockon">Knock-On</a> is awesome. All phones should have it. It's a great way to make sure the power button survives your phone contract. I have already tried to do it on other devices unconsciously.</li>
	<li>There is a huge amount of LG bloatware, but I weirdly don't find it as oppressive as <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/10/31/phablet-couture-or-how-i/">Touchwiz</a>. It was a big deal in the Droid X days, but now you can just disable things you won't use.</li>
	<li>The processor can handle it all, too. Top of the top of the line (and yes, I typed that twice). But then, so can the Nexus 5, because they share the same processor and amount of RAM.</li>
	<li>I understand the Nexus is bloat-free, but that doesn't mean you don't also take time to set it up as your own. It probably took 1.5-2 days to set this phone up the way I like it, and would probably take about half that on the Nexus.</li>
	<li>Battery life has been fantastic, but damn does it get hot playing Plants vs. Zombies 2.</li>
	<li>The back casing is horrible. Feels like a toy phone the first time, then it just feels gross because it sucks all the oils from your hand onto the phone. Gets pretty greasy.</li>
	<li>That is easily remedied by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poetic-Palette-Case-Black-Only/dp/B00E5NP1KC/ref=sr_sp-btf_title_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1384285829&sr=8-4&keywords=lg+g2+case">Poetic Palette case</a>, which adds a soft touch to the back but leaves the smooth bezels. I like them for some reason.</li>
	<li>The case also frames the rear buttons, making them slightly easier to find. The button design works in theory, but practice is a different story. Your index finger does not naturally rest where these buttons are, as your thumb does on every other phone you've ever used (top power buttons are for iPhones). You also can't adjust the volume of the phone if it is sitting on a table; it has to be in your hand, which seems dumb.</li>
	<li>This is odd, because LG is one of the only manufacturers forgoing the front hardware buttons (home, back, menu). I put that firmly in the plus column. Android itself removed the necessity of hardware buttons 2 years and 4 major software revisions ago with the Galaxy Nexus, a phone with a special place in my heart.</li>
</ul>
Saturday is the end of my 14-day return period for this phone, and the Nexus drops there <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Thursday</span> next Wednesday (in store).<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> I was really hoping for some overlap there, but I still can't bring myself to keep the G2. The power user in me (the one that was mashing the F5 button on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/Nexus_5_32GB_Black?id=nexus_5_black_32gb">Play Store</a> on Halloween) recoils at the cartoony animations throughout the G2 UX. Maybe someday the hardware manufacturers will understand that their custom software is their weakness. I want to see what this hardware can do when the software gets out of the way.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> I don't want an LG phone - I want <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/5/5069310/the-nexus-5-isnt-pure-android-its-pure-google/in/4815723">a <em>Google</em> phone</a>. So much so that I am willing to buy a burner and wait 3-4 days to get one.

I was floored this week when they started talking about video games. But, like the hosts, I also never hear about really productive people who always sound like they have their life together playing lots of video games. It is something I will try to do more often. Of course, it helps that I am also currently addicted to Tiny Death Star.</p>

			 <p><span style="line-height:1.5;">Music is a staple of human civilization. Musicians are staples of music. Being exploited and undervalued is a staple of being a musician, especially if you listen to them long enough that they start talking instead of music-ing. Even in the early twentieth century when prerecorded music became a staple of movies, musicians were not happy with their lot. It is not a new concept, and the latest iteration of this argument has musicians </span><a style="line-height:1.5;" href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/29/spotify-vs-musicians-streaming-royalties">battling music streaming services over royalties</a><span style="line-height:1.5;">. If these problems have been around for so long, why can&rsquo;t anyone figure this out?</span></p>
<p>Growing up in the Napster age, I have a weird relationship with music. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong; I love listening to music. It&rsquo;s just the discovering and buying and playing where my views are a little more fluid than the previous generation. For instance, I feel like there was probably a time when radio was relevant, and I keep hearing that MTV played music when Kurt Cobain was alive. Now, however, the interwebs bring meager fame to bands that would likely have never been in the MTV rotation, and in flyover country you are lucky to get anything on the radio other than just that: country.</p>
<h4>History lessons</h4>
Let's go back to the beginning. The first CD I ever bought with my own money was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubthumper">by Chumbawamba</a>, which I have come to terms with but realize I will have to acknowledge for the rest of my life like a bad tattoo. (For the record, I did marginally better on my first tape purchase with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Jam_(soundtrack)">Space Jam</a>) Then came Napster, which was shutdown by the time I tried to install it on my family's PC (75 MHz processors and dial-up had something to do with that). The local library really never caught on to the borrow-burn-return technique, though, so I got by. I finally found out about cool music around age 16, <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/04/01/comedown-machine/">starting with the Strokes</a> and a subscription to SPIN. My first MP3 player was a college move-in gift, which I soon flipped for the first iPod generation to have a color screen [<a href="#footnote-1">1</a>].
<p>iTunes is all well and good unless you are (A.) a poor college student and (B.) that college has a fairly robust internal file sharing network. I would say my digital music collection increased by about 50% by sophomore year (we&rsquo;re talking double-digit gigabytes here), but growth has been stagnant since those halcyon days for several reasons. The low cost of entry back then is one, and the sheer difficulty to discover interesting, new music on the cheap is another. I gladly bought music from artists I enjoyed, but only because they were already on my radar. Thirty second previews never feel like enough to justify buying something I may not like &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been burned before (see Chumbawamba).</p>
<h4>Interwebs killed the radio (star)</h4>
That is all coming back around now with the advent of streaming music. Pandora broke the mold with an amazing engine of music association and recommendation, and Rdio and Spotify (and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4334790/google-music-all-access-hands-on-versus-spotify-rdio">seemingly everyone else</a> now)[<a href="#footnote-2">2</a>] has applied the Netflix model to music. This is the future of music, regardless of whether record labels will accept it or not. The barriers to discovery as they were even 5 years ago are non-existent. I have found more music in the last 6 months than I had in the previous 3-4 years using these services. My conscience is far cleaner than in my file sharing days, and I get the convenience of access wherever I want.
<p>So, bottom line. If this reaches any music executives, heed these words: Ten dollars a month seems like the right price for all the music I never paid for in the first place. Make it work, and pay the musicians so they keep music-ing. I have pirated before, and taking that away will make me likely to do it again.

<p>I would be remiss at this point if I did not mention my Audioscrobbler neé <a href="http://last.fm/user/pilch">last.fm</a> profile, which has chronicled roughly 80-90% of the music I have listened to for nearly 10 years. Probably not valuable information, but at least I can claim to have been a Kings of Leon fan back when they had beards and were cool.[<a href="#footnote-3">3</a>]</p>

<p>This is probably a blog post for another time, but right now my favorites are Rdio and Google Play All Access. Even though both those services are great, though, I feel like I could throw something together between Pandora and Plex that would do even better for a lower price (and I even got the early bird price on Play).</p>

<p>They are still kind of cool, but also kind of sold out. Another blog post for another time.</p>

			 <p>I've had a Galaxy Note 2 for about 6 months. I bought it because I got the itch to upgrade, and it was the best Android phone available at the time (caveat: on Verizon. I would have gladly gone with the HTC One, or Nexus 4, or any other flagship device that skipped Verizon for <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/06/05/the-trouble-with-mobile/">reasons I outlined a while back</a>). Being a ROM aficionado, I knew hardware was the biggest factor for me. My loyal Galaxy Nexus was a solid phone, but with heavy use it would die by early afternoon without a charger nearby. Better processor and gigantic battery (and dearth of options) made the Note 2 a no-brainer.</p>
<p>But I heard a panelist on a recent episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-google">This Week in Google</a> (could have been All About Android too) talk about the zen of wanting the phone you have, or something like that. It is a noble concept, and I tried to live up to it with my previous phone (until I didn't). But it is easy to do with a Nexus device, or an iPhone, because you are at ground zero of the operating system. So I dove down the rabbit hole that is Touchwiz, to look for enlightenment.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Been down this rabbit hole before</h4>
<p>This was a formidable challenge, too. After spending my first 2 years of smartphone ownership in the hellscape of MotoBlur, my reluctance for anything but <a href="http://source.android.com/index.html">AOSP</a> (or stock Android, to the uninitiated) cannot be overstated. My initial reaction to any overly skinned version of Android is usually minor wretching. The Verge put it well in their <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/1/4787994/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review">review of the new Note 3</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pen Window is almost something you have to see in person to really grasp how silly it is.</p></blockquote>
<p>This can be said for many features Samsung packs into these phones. I am supposed to live with this device for 2 years, according to my carrier. I am not looking for "silly."</p>
<p>That being said, there are some very useful features. Before, I would have to download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en">Tasker</a>, re-learn how to use it, and hack around to get settings automated on my phone. Samsung preempted this use case and launches menus automatically when I do things like plug in my headphones or pull out the S-pen stylus. It follows that if I do those things, I am going to do something with my phone. Touchwiz lubricates that interaction.</p>
<p>The S-pen would probably increase smartphone adoption among the older demographic if it were packaged with more phones. There is something satisfying about pulling it out and launching the built-in note app and jotting things down. It is still not faster than typing; the last several years have conditioned me to type faster than I write. But I am still conditioned to remember things that I write down with a pen or pencil.</p>
<p>The size is not that big of an issue, pun intended. You acclimate pretty quickly. I do miss being able to reach the opposite upper corner of the screen with my thumb, as Google has slowly moved Android design to use it more often for menu overflow. Other than that, though, I have no trouble operating the phone with one hand. Touchwiz (and <a href="http://www.swiftkey.net/en/blog/new-beta-layouts-for-living/">now Swiftkey</a>, actually) uses customizable keyboards for one-handed use on larger devices.</p>
<h4>Greener grass</h4>
<p>For all its usefulness, I keep pining for features that are native to newer versions of Android. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock&hl=en">Dash Clock</a> has probably been the first app I install on every 4.2.x-and-up ROM I've used since it was released. Actionable notifications are fantastic, and I often use the ability to expand and minimize them at will. And it pains me to use a phone with hardware buttons anymore after the GNexus proved them to be unnecessary. Samsung, though, has kept this phone running the software it was released with, nearly a year later. The only reason it will get a 4.3 update at all is Samsung's ill conceived smartwatch that (as of right now) only works with the Note 3.</p>
<p>But there is still that part of me, once I arrive back on AOSP, that misses the pen features and the other custom Samsung firmware. So I would switch back. I have been indulging this fickle dual-boot scenario for almost a month. I still haven't landed on one or the other.</p>
<p>Luckily, this first world problem has solved itself. My wife has an upgrade, but Verizon won't let us keep our unlimited data if she uses it. I did some research and found that T-Mobile covers our area, has unlimited data, and will save us a bit over $500/year over the course of our next contract (In fairness, VZW would save us ~$300/year if it took away our unlimited data). We can stick it to Verizon, and I can finally hop to the flagship phone I was looking for 6 months ago. Hello Nexus 5!</p>

			 <p>I started a list several months ago of <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/12/the-master-list/">iOS-first applications</a> that had everything to gain from launching on Android <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/12/the-master-list-tracker-feb/">but seemingly just decided not to</a>. Far from complete, and probably like the third post I had ever written on anything, but it was a start. Anyways, this morning on All About Android I heard about <a href="http://stevecheney.com/why-android-first-is-a-myth/">this guy</a> who tried to elucidate the point in probably the most smug way possible. The tone makes me feel like he would carry hand sanitizer around just in case he accidentally touched an HTC One. So here is my attempt to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Joe_Morgan">FJM</a> this whole thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. &ldquo;In the US, iOS market share is still extremely strong (even pre-iPhone 5s launch data showed Android having</em> <em>peaked, so Q4 data will be interesting with Apple’s refresh)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, since you aren’t going to bother with data, I guess I will: Android covers <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/08/06/us-smartphone-market-share-q2-2013-nielsen/">52% of the US market</a> to iOS’s 40%. But, if you want to go anecdotally too, I know someone who is dropping iOS entirely because of a gamebreaking iOS7 bug that neither AT&amp;T nor Apple has remedied. This makes me doubt that iOS will make up that 12% gap in Q4.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Since the vast majority of innovative mobile startups come out of the US, Apple’s stronghold domestically has an absolutely massive impact on developer mindshare</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are a lot of US startups, because there are a lot of US VCs with a lot of disposable income. Apple’s “stronghold” doesn’t impact developer mindshare, it impacts VC mindshare, because they fall into <a href="http://trends.e-strategyblog.com/2013/06/19/demographics-of-us-android-iphone-owners/12057">iOS’s affluent demographic</a>. It is a status symbol to them. That doesn’t make it better or easier to develop for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. All of my conversations over the past year with Android developers…  building and releasing on Android costs 2-3x more than iOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, anecdotal again. Here’s an anecdote: Any.DO (just featured <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/9/4817146/taskmasters-how-israeli-intelligence-officers-helped-inspire-the-look-of-ios-7">on The Verge for inspiring the design of iOS7</a> you love so much) started… on Android! DUN DUN DUN! It <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/12/any-do-android-500000/">built up the hype</a> there before <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/05/any-dos-to-do-list-app-hits-100000-ios-downloads-in-24-hours/">hitting iOS</a>, and I would say it worked out well for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3. The effort required to build and release an app is severely gated by capital-raising…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>These structural limitations around capital raising for venture-backed companies…</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><em><em>yawn</em> </em>First world problems. You don’t even use the word ‘mobile’ (let alone ‘iOS’) until #5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5. To build a mobile app with $1M in capital, a startup can roughly afford to hire one designer, one client developer (iOS or Android) and one back end engineer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the bias. You know who had more than one of each of these (and definitely more capital)? Twitter, after <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20121009/twitter-buys-vine-a-video-clip-company-that-never-launched/">buying Vine</a>. They had nearly 3 months to at least add viewing capability for their Android client before its public release, which was already iOS-only anyway. But maybe that is a bad example. Again, Any.DO shows that you can do Android just as well <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/10/any-do-launches-a-social-to-do-list-app-with-1-million-in-funding/">with the same ‘constraints’.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>6. Almost zero startups are going Android-first under these constraints. Why? Because founders know they have an extremely high bar to prove traction on the primary platform, before they can raise additional financing and accelerate into two platforms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this is a fallacy - see my answer to #2 again. Unless you think the “extremely high bar” is somehow lower on iOS. And it might be, when you have (generally) affluent guys paying (generally) affluent guys to create an app for a platform used by (generally) affluent people. It would be hard to get that kind of ‘vision’ to sync across stages of development on platforms with a more diverse base of users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>7. So it’s well known in tech circles today that seed round sizes constrain app development to a single primary platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, that may be a point. My broken-record answer of Any.DO did start on only one platform, and most others start on the other platform. But in general, I would ignore any sentence featuring the phrase ‘it’s well known in tech circles’, much like ‘quantum mechanics.’</p>
<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1240/"><img alt="image" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/quantum_mechanics.png"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And startups are choosing to go iOS first not only because development is cheaper and easier, but also because money for in-app purchases and advertising is overwhelmingly skewed toward iOS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be true. Once again, I will do your research for you, instead of relying on ‘tech circles’ - Play Store revenue is <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-play-revenue-pales-in-comparison-to-app-store-2013-10">up to 35% of global app revenue market share</a>, leaving Apple with a huge advantage. It may never be on par with Apple here, but it is hard to compete with an install base of (generally) affluent (generally) white users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, a <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/10/16/facebook-ad-profit-a-staggering-1790-more-on-iphone-than-android/">recent study of Facebook ads</a> shows ads were 1,790% more profitable on iOS. This is extremely incriminating for Android and is the worst kind of news for Google.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do Facebook ads have to do with anything? I see Facebook ads on my Galaxy Note 2, and they suck because they are not relevant to me, so I don’t click on them. I only see them in the Facebook app, which is not made by a startup, and probably launched on both platforms as quickly as humanly possible. It is not bad news for Google, it is bad news for Facebook on Android.</p>
<p>You want incriminating? Ad revenue generated on iOS <a jref="http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-ad-revenue-by-platform-2013-10">has fallen 11% in market share since last year</a>, while Android has remained steady. I didn’t even have to use a ridiculously large number from a third party that has nothing to do with my overall point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>8. Since iOS better supports startups’ ability to prove metrics requisite for raising Series A rounds from institutional investors, the earliest most innovative services are almost always available first on iOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The metrics you gave in #3 were: <em>significant traction, repeatable user acquisition strategy, early ideas toward monetization, etc</em>. What do those have to do with platform at all? Download counts and active users are easily found in the Play Store and its developer console. User acquisition is definitely platform agnostic, and if anything, Android users can get the word out about a new app they are using with the built-in share menu that is light years ahead of iOS. And - repeat - see #2 to show it can be done.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="9">
<li>… often these startups become acquihires for the top mobile acquirers (FB, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Dropbox, etc). Because they are almost always shutdown at acquihire, big companies often have some of the most talented iOS engineers and product people in residence for a 1 to 2 year earn-out period. Without a doubt, these employees skew toward iOS when they join internal projects or think up new ideas. And when they eventually leave, there is a good chance they’ll stick with iOS again. There is no doubt this forms a sort of virtuous circle of iOS-first talent in the startup community.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a symptom, not a cause. You can substitute Android for iOS in that paragraph, and it would be a symptom of Android-first, not the cause of it. And why is this ‘virtuous’? Did you mean to type ‘vicious,’ but your iPhone keyboard autocorrected it? A little Freudian if you ask me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While in theory Android provides a very modern platform for mobile development,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gravity is also a theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Startups simply cannot afford to bypass iOS and go Android out of the gate. One could even argue the gap is widening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gap is widening only in the minds of people like you. You perpetuate this stereotype, and this is the reason companies that are not startups, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57607611-94/nikes-no-android-stance-on-fuelband-is-a-huge-mistake/">like Nike</a>, completely skip over half the mobile market in favor of the first choice among the (generally) affluent ‘tech circles.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reality is that software innovation at the app layer is accelerating, and converged hardware / software development costs a lot of money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is accelerating because there is competition. And starting on a certain platform before moving to another does cost money, but that is not a reason to start on the same platform every time. The startup issue is a chicken and egg scenario, and nothing is going to change until VCs start laying their eggs on the other side of the proverbial fence.</p>

			 <p>I can’t decide if flying Southwest is worth it or not. It is generally not that much cheaper than Delta, especially to regional stops. The free checked bags are nice - I paid a few hundred dollars to fly myself here, I’m not putting up another $35 for my belongings to go too. But the vibe feels a little off-putting, and I am pretty sure it is their “seat yourself” policy.</p>
<p>We got on in the early B group for a couple flights, so we got on behind roughly 60 people. None of them sit together apparently. Each time, they filled up the first 20 or so rows by taking the aisle and window seats, and leaving the middle. They all know goddamn well that it was a full flight, and this is just going to slow everyone down, but they did it anyway. Then on our return flights, I didn’t check in until a few hours before, which means to Southwest you might as well be riding with the luggage. Sure enough, the 120 or so people had sat in 4 columns through the back of the plane, middle seats the only ones left. I understand the middle seat can be uncomfortable or whatever, but the lady in the aisle seat next to my wife had her husband sitting <em>i</em><em>n the aisle seat directly across from her</em>. Who does that? The lady had a Louis Vuitton bag. Who flies Southwest with a Louis Vuitton bag? And sits in the back of the plane?</p>
<p>I paid the upgrade fee for the last leg home to get on the plane first. I just wanted to sit with my wife and watch Doctor Who on my tablet. I bought a headphone splitter weeks ago. And on Delta, or whatever other airline you like, I would have known weeks ago that we were sitting together and could use it, even if we were the last people to board. Sure, I would have to lug my suitcase on with me, but you know what? <em>Everyone does this on Southwest too</em>. I don’t know if they aren’t aware or just pack way too much. Our last plane was delayed 15 minutes because seemingly everyone checked 2 bags, and they took their sweet time loading them up.</p>
<p>So there it is. The Southwest upcharge isn’t hidden with bags. It is hidden in your flight experience. It is a weird combination of party bus and muted commuter hostility that you have to pay to escape — well, not even “escape”, but “get in front of”. It works going to Vegas, but is a little bit off everywhere else.</p>
<p>Stray observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The percentage of passengers who will talk to you goes from maybe 5% on other airlines to about 40% on a Southwest flight, in my experience. It is pleasant conversation, usually.</span></li>
<li><span>Lot of gray hairs. I don’t know enough to attribute it to flying on a Monday or to the airline, but a lot of them had coupons.</span></li>
<li><span>Glad I got to travel before “TSA agents” turned into “unpaid TSA agents.”</span></li>
</ul>

			 <p>I am stuck in the second half of my 2 year phone contract. The first half is when the phone is all new and shiny and the manufacturer keeps it up to date with current software. The second half is when all those benefits fade and you are still on the hook for another year. For whatever reason the a one year contract tier is now a thing of the past. Locked down or contract-free are the only options left.</p>
<p>On top of that, my contract is with Big V (for “Voldemort”, but worse). Verizon has built a great network, but it is <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/android/22283/verizon-android-enthusiasts">horrible for tech enthusiasts</a> (I have no experience with AT&amp;T, which is probably just as awful, but <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/15/4335262/google-hangout-video-chats-dont-work-on-att-cellular-connections-but-why">in different ways</a>). I don’t have a landline (and who could afford one with the price of a smartphone plan?), so sticking with solid service seems to make sense. But I also don’t make many calls, so my gigantic cell phone plan is mainly for data. That’s not so bad, because it is unlimited. At least, until Verizon caps my data when I renew my contract.</p>
<p>Other random VZW problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can’t use their phones anywhere outside the US without paying out the nose. This is a Sprint problem too, because neither use GSM technology, but I’m not sure that Sprint requires you to <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2044449">hack <strong>THEIR OWN</strong> global phones</a> to get them to work correctly</li>
<li>They instated <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/4/11/2940982/verizon-wireless-upgrade-fee-announced">this fee</a> two weeks before my last official upgrade (mostly just personal bitterness there)</li>
<li>They don’t <a href="https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013">fight for users’ privacy rights.</a> Even Comcast and AT&amp;T pretend like they care.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, they are an easy target for user ire. Rightfully so, because of how much of my time and my income is spent on them and their phones. But this brings up another major problem. Demanding the highest quality devices from the company with the highest quality wireless service should not be the leap in logic that the market is making it out to be. New flagship phones are coming to VZW late or not at all, and I believe the reason is the Galaxy Nexus Saga.</p>
<p>In October 2011, Google unveiled Android 4.0 and its flagship device, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus">Galaxy Nexus</a>, exclusive to Verizon in the US. Presumed to be the ideal phone on the ideal carrier, it would receive timely updates from Google because it ran stock Android (the specific reason I bought it!) while running on the fast VZW LTE network. But then the phone was delayed for a month while Verizon <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/10/3751538/verizon-google-wallet-galaxy-nexus-secure-element">disallowed Google from putting its own Wallet software on the phone.</a> After release, each new Android iteration would update international and unlocked GNex units, leaving VZW customers months behind. The phone is finally up to date as of March, over a year after its release. I have heard it called the Fallacy Nexus (by nerds), and I am inclined to agree.</p>
<p>The problem with mobile computing is this carrier influence. Even <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/5/3138711/five-years-after-the-iphone-carriers-are-the-biggest-threat-to-innovation-editorial">five years ago</a>, the hardware and software used for personal computing was controlled by (surprise!!) the hardware and software companies selling the computers. Now  that most personal computing is done on phones, the phone companies have changed that dynamic. They push the innovators into conservative design decisions, market only the devices that kowtow to their demands, and preach “pay no attention to the duopoly in the corner.” Until they function like a (mostly) dumb pipe like cable internet, this is the way the world will be.

			 <p>I will start off by saying <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/04/path/">I am a Path apologist</a>. I love the app; it is my go-to for sharing moments from my phone. The design is cutting edge, and the concept works well. I began using it around their second major release (found out about it <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5872488/the-social-network-that-stole-christmas">here</a>) before their last <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5883395/paths-big-mistake-was-doing-something-unexpected-with-our-data">privacy kerfuffle</a>. This was serious, but they fixed the issue almost immediately. They ended up paying an FTC fine for accidentally collecting this contact data from minors (which, again, it immediately deleted).</p>
<p>Path went on its merry way, creating new ways to interact for Facebook to copy (see: <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/12/20/paths-new-search-feature-is-a-big-deal/">Path’s search</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Graph_Search">Graph Search</a>, launched in beta a month later). But when the only major story about you has been a privacy issue, that seems to be all anyone remembers. This past issue frames new attempts at growth in a bad light, which is why the tech media is accusing Path of <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/04/30/path-is-spamming-users-contacts-with-random-messages-and-calls/">spammiing users’ contacts</a>.</p>
<p>The “spam” in question, which, albeit annoying, is far preferable to whatever other monolithic networks are doing without telling you. Furthermore, it is most likely due to user error. I have never heard any of my contacts complaining about spam from Path (contacts - please correct me if this assumption is wrong), and I know from use that there are 2 prompts to go through before Path gets any of my contacts’ info. It invited a couple family members, but only when I specifically told it to do so. Path’s biggest issues here are <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/path-update-hits-android-messaging-stickers-and-shop#comment-564249">occasional lag time</a> (which is probably why these “spam” messages were sent after this guy uninstalled the app) and selecting everyone for invite by default. It is a little uncouth, but it is an easy fix - last I checked (after the latest update), the “Invite Friends” list left my contacts unchecked by default.</p>
<p>I realize that some people see this as a second strike on privacy, but the team at Path has shown that, while they make a few sloppy mistakes every once in a while, they are committed to fixing those mistakes and keeping users’ trust, not <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/may/02/social-network-path-growing-fast">alienating them</a> as the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/30/4286090/path-is-spamming-address-books-with-unwanted-texts-and-robocalls">tech media seems to think</a>. No matter how <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/my-phone/2013/03/dave-morin-path-facebook-apple">douchey</a> the CEO might be, people should soon realize Path makes a product they would enjoy greatly, and is <strong>FREE TO USE</strong>. They occasionally accidentally use your data to contact people you know, and then fix it when they realize the mistake. In my book, that always beats <a href="http://www.wired.com/business/2013/05/facebook-is-growing-through-risky-business/">selling your data</a> to people you will never meet.</p><br>

			 <p>Video games are a staple of culture, regardless of <a href="http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/video-games-can-never-be-art">what Roger Ebert thought</a> (RIP). The joke is that parents let TV raise their kids, but my generation was raised by Nintendo (or Sega), and the current generation is raised by the spectre of Steve Jobs. These relationships are two way streets as well; video games are coming of age along with us, and it is extremely satisfying to experience a game done right in all its facets. I just finished the newest game in this category: <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/bioshock-infinite">Bioshock Infinite</a>, and it knocked my figurative socks off.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com (because Merriam-Webster’s website buried this general definition) defines art as <em>the quality, production, expression, or realm, according to aesthetic principles, of what is beautiful, appealing, or of more than ordinary significance.</em> In his piece, Ebert uses Plato’s definition of art, <em>the imitation of nature</em>, but he goes on to say that art “improves or alters nature through an passage through what we might call the artist’s soul, or vision,” and that it is a matter of taste. Clearly he never met <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Levine_(game_developer)">Ken Levine</a>. Ebert chose to see beauty expressed through the lens of cinema, and sadly did not take the time to find “more than ordinary significance” in the Bioshocks and the Mass Effects and the Fallouts of the world. The saddest part is that he probably would have enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Video game reviews like to deal in technical aspects like graphics and gameplay mechanics, but trying that with something as poignant as Bioshock is a bit like forming an opinion on a novel based on its grammar and spelling accuracy. “The margins were consistent throughout, but the font made the letter G look weird.” Things like that. But video game reviews tend that way because there has never been much substance above that. I think that is what makes it hard for gamers like myself to synthesize these ideas from a video game and put them into words. (Or it could be that I just don’t write a lot.)</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&ldquo;alignright&rdquo; width=&ldquo;300&rdquo;]<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bioshock-infinite-columbia.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured" title="BioShock Infinite takes place on the steampunk..." alt="BioShock Infinite takes place on the steampunk..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/46/Bioshock-infinite-columbia.jpg/300px-Bioshock-infinite-columbia.jpg" width="300" height="169"></a> BioShock Infinite takes place on the steampunk air-city of Columbia. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)[/caption]</p>
<p>Experiencing the story of Booker DeWitt and the flying city of Columbia through any other medium would not evoke the same reaction. I am convinced of that much. Sure, on paper, you could still form your own ideas about his motivations and your own relationship with Elizabeth. One could picture an actor swinging on sky lines, catching ammo cartridges from an actress on the big screen (see footnote). But it would not match the immersion of Infinite.</p>
<p>That is what great games offer: total sensory immersion into a world, at an unprecedented level. You don’t just read about it, and you don’t just watch someone act it out in front of a green screen. You explore as you see fit, you make the decisions, and you suffer the consequences. And I am only referring to single-player games here, because adding other human-controlled elements makes this another conversation entirely. One can find a deeply personal, touching and gratifying experience with buttons and joysticks and keyboards in hand, and it makes me happy to live in this brave new world.</p>
<p>TL;DR Two thumbs way, <strong>way</strong> up.</p>
<p>(Footnote: I’m thinking maybe Jon Hamm playing Booker, Zooey Deschanel as Elizabeth, <a href="http://video.adultswim.com/frisky-dingo/three-quick-shots.html">Anthony Hopkins</a> as Comstock, Tilda Swinton as Lutece.)</p>

			 <p>So, I hadn’t been on Facebook directly <a href="https://pilch.me/2013/03/02/facebook-break/">for about a month</a> until a couple nights ago (not counting one post from Spotify, where I tried to post to Twitter instead of FB but did the opposite - stupid share buttons). Man, the nostalgia wave was intense. I enjoyed my sojourn into the internet wilderness for a month, but this one relapse visit just made it feel lonely.</p>
<p>My renewed interest was piqued by their announcement of <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4183172/facebook-home-android">Facebook Home</a>. It is an intriguing concept. The cynic in me knows they just want to put one less layer between you and them (and their ads). The pragmatist in me knows that Android has been dying for some kind of integrated messaging ala iMessage, and this looks like a great solution (until Google announces their own at I/O next month). It is another great way for them to leverage their user base and practically inevitable since their introduction of their own app system. Facebook is the only social network robust enough to attempt something like this. I will try it out of morbid curiosity, and will probably start sharing things there more often. At least until <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/5/4187062/facebook-home-is-beautiful-but-what-if-your-friends-arent">I want control again.</a></p>
<p>But, that aside, it was very easy to function without Facebook. There was more time to read important things, like literature. My phone locked up less often, honestly. I could find updates in other places if I needed to know how someone was doing.</p>
<p>Coming back was even easier, though. One picture posted, 5 likes by the end of the night. Churning out content is fairly easy, but without a built-in audience, what is the point? I guess when the average user is ready to drop out of there and go somewhere else, I know that I will be ready too.</p><br>

			 <p>I didn’t listen to <em>Is This It</em> until after I had heard <em>Room On Fire</em>. That means I have no hipster cred, and was not fully aware of the hype surrounding both (but primarily the first) at the time. Much like the <a href="http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9096863/the-strokes-career-arc-it-their-new-album-comedown-machine" target="_blank">Grantland review</a>, I have days where I think the latter is better than the former. But damn, it does not get much better than the simplistic beauty of tracks 2-4, or 1-8, or hell, the whole debut album of The Strokes.</p>
<p>I was hooked. I have bought all the albums since then, on release day. I bought most of the solo albums, and listened to the rest online. It’s how I was able to recognize Little Joy (Fab!) when it appeared in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jSUVKOpR9w" target="_blank">VW commercial</a>. It’s the reason I don’t understand why it is cool to hate The Strokes.</p>
<p>Music journalism has a nebulous goal: to translate the sonic and aesthetic qualities of a musical work or group into the written medium, which inherently cannot convey all of said qualities. And the world (from America’s perspective) was in a weird place after 9/11 (understatement like that deserves its own font). So that world simultaneously embraced NYC rock saviors and revolted against the hype machine that built itself around them. As <a href="http://www.spin.com/reviews/the-strokes-comedown-machine-rca" target="_blank">Spin put forth</a>, what would <em>Is This It</em> have been like in the age of Twitter? It might have still been polarizing, but I still feel like I would fall into the same camp.</p>
<p>As of right now, I have “All The Time” stuck in my head. “Tap Out” is interesting, and my favorite is “Welcome To Japan.” All in all, it is a good album, and it is a Strokes album. I am holding out hope that they will do more now that they have fulfilled their RCA contract, and that this album was just to be done with that (no fanfare? stock demo logo as album art?). I guess what I am trying to say is: Hi, I’m pilch, and I am a Strokes fan. [<em>hi pilch</em>] I’ve been a Strokes fan for roughly 10 years. I don’t really care about the next 11 steps in the process, I just needed to get that out there.</p>

			 <p>Since the advent of broadband internet, and even a bit before, “piracy” has been a problem. I use quotes because there is probably a better term that evokes illicit copying rather than Captain Hook. It is one of those problems that is supposed to get the same reaction from anyone. Asking a congressman to justify almost anything they do yields the response “because ______.” Only one of the following reasons is acceptable to fill in that blank:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Terrorists</li>
	<li> The children</li>
	<li> Piracy</li>
</ul>
Why is our defense budget so high? Because terrorists. Why do we need to take away all the guns/arm all the teachers? Because the children. Why can’t we unlock our cell phones? Because Nazis… I mean, because piracy.
<p>No one is learning how wrong-headed that is right now more than EA. They bought and resurrected one of the most beloved and storied game franchises of all time, Sim City. It released this week, and <a href="http://www.polygon.com/game/simcity-2013/2630" target="_blank">was purported to be fantastic</a>. The majority of the people who bought it, though, apparently would not know. EA designed this game to require a constant connection to their servers, even though it is essentially a single player experience. They claim it is for a social aspect, so people can share cities or something, but let’s be honest: it is for piracy. EA wants your $50-60, and wants to make damn sure that you can’t play if you didn’t pay. (Also hilarious: <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/3/7/4076570/ea-not-offering-simcity-refunds" target="_blank">they are not offering refunds</a>.)</p>
<p>In an ironic twist, many who did pay still can’t play. EA has been working on adding servers all week to support demand, to no avail. Rather than updating the game to remove the requirement of connectivity, they have decided to save their precious game-breaking DRM by disabling the actual game features that require the internet, like leaderboards. Kotaku has billed this fiasco “<a href="http://kotaku.com/simcity-disaster_watch/" target="_blank">Sim City Disaster Watch</a>.” Polygon, who initally gave the game a review score of 9.5/10, has lowered its score to a 4. I can’t say it better than Chris Kluwe:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Next question @<a href="https://twitter.com/simcity">simcity</a>: How many lost sales do you predict from word of mouth versus general piracy rates? What does the maff say?
<p>— Chris Kluwe (@ChrisWarcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisWarcraft/status/309783817089060864">March 7, 2013</a></p>
</blockquote>
 
<p>The other end of the spectrum is Game of Thrones (or it is a different spectrum, not sure). HBO could care less that it is the most pirated TV show for a couple years running, because it gets people talking about Game of Thrones. However, in their case, it is more about necessity than stealing. <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/game_of_thrones" target="_blank">They offer no other avenues of purchase</a> besides subscribing to their network (on top of a cable subscription, in the age of cable cutting).</p>
<p>Really, there has to be some middle ground here somewhere. A way for a company to take my money in exchange for a good product. Capitalism, maybe?</p>

<p>Twitter dug itself into a deeper hole with its power users last night when it <a title="Twitter discontinuing Tweetdeck" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/4/4064708/twitter-discontinuing-tweetdeck-apps">axed the non-web versions of Tweetdeck</a>. It is somehow both totally uncalled for and long overdue. Twitter<a title="Twitter Buys Tweetdeck" href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million/"> purchased Tweetdeck in mid-2011</a>, when it was easily the best mobile Twitter client and arguably the best Facebook client at the time as well. As the picture illustrates, Twitter updated Tweetdeck only once, to remove its native picture sharing service, and it has languished in the Google Play Store ever since. In that time, Twitter has moved to a newer, locked-down API and has a new official app on most platforms. However, Tweetdeck arguably still has a better interface, as well as far more features.</p>
<p>I cannot make sense of this. I don&rsquo;t think I would be mad if they integrated Tweetdeck&rsquo;s columns into the default app&rsquo;s interface, because it would greatly improve tracking conversations. Twitter has list functionality, but on mobile they are buried so far down they are practically useless. And why did Twitter sit on this app for a year and a half if they were just going to shut it down? They could have updated it, or just removed Facebook from it if that was the issue. Pushing an inferior version of your own product just to get people to look at ads is not the way to win the tech crowd.</p>
<p>Anyway, they already <a title="How to Share Online" href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/26/how-to-share-online/">pushed me</a> over to <a href="https://alpha.app.net/pilch">app.net</a>, where I am hoping that someone will resurrect the Tweetdeck client in spirit.</p>

			 <p>I finally uninstalled the Facebook app on my phone about two weeks ago, mostly because it sucks. I checked back a few nights ago via the browser, and I had not missed much of anything (except an old friend getting engaged - congrats!). The next logical step is to stop sharing things on Facebook. For the better part of a year, I have prided myself on doing my sharing almost exclusively through third-party avenues (because I want control over my data, and I am a <a title="How to Share Online" href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/26/how-to-share-online/">social network hipster</a>), and the only step left is to stop.</p>
<p>Why do I go back, even to share? Because everyone else is there. Facebook has been around for eons in Internet Time. In the beginning, it functioned more like an actual <a title="Facebook (directory)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_(directory)">&ldquo;face book&rdquo;</a>, which people did not update daily. However, it was still people you actually knew and wanted to keep up with. Those roots continue to reinforce themselves over time as you build a digital archive of yourself, but what is left is a gargantuan filter bubble. It is much harder to break out of a filter bubble of people you know IRL, which Facebook knows. That is why the point of the site was lost somewhere between the immediate, actual, meaningful connections and <a title="Lifehacker: How Facebook Is Using You to Annoy Your Friends" href="http://lifehacker.com/5987248/how-facebook-is-using-you-to-annoy-your-friends-and-how-to-stop-it" target="_blank">&ldquo;Your friends like Diet Coke, you should too!&quot;</a> (Of course, <a title="The Verge: Facebook invites press to March 7 event" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/1/4044114/facebook-invites-press-to-come-see-a-new-look-for-news-feed">this could all change in a week</a>.)</p>
<p>The laundry list of things Facebook actually does is pretty impressive until you consider that several other places offer the same service, usually better. General status updates work very well on Twitter; if it is longer than 140 characters, get a blog. Dropbox, Flickr, and Picasa all offer picture storage and sharing, with the added bonus of export. Instant messaging can be done with GTalk, iMessage, or the mother of all internet communique: email. Link sharing and other content curation are Tumblr&rsquo;s forte. Foursquare has check-ins locked down. Personal moments meant to be shared with only close friends and family can be set up easily in Path or Google+. In fact, G+ does pretty much all of this, and shares it more intuitively than Facebook.</p>
<p><a title="Lifehacker: How Facebook Is Using You To Annoy Your Friends" href="http://lifehacker.com/5987248/how-facebook-is-using-you-to-annoy-your-friends-and-how-to-stop-it" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a> beat me to it, but the way Facebook has adapted their advertising is annoying, albeit nefariously intuitive. Ads themselves are not all that bad. The service has to make money somehow. Google is basically an advertising company, but aside from the search results page it is generally unobtrusive, and the service is good enough that it warrants forgiveness. Almost all the services mentioned are ad-supported, and the alternative to that is paying your own way with something like <a title="app.net - @pilch" href="https://alpha.app.net/pilch">App.net</a>.</p>
<p>So, for those visiting from my Facebook link, <a title="Hitoshi" href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~haj/iliekmilk.html" target="_blank">welcome to my page</a>. You may see it pop up occasionally on my FB feed in the future, but independence has to start somewhere. One last cleanup of various outdated likes and other personal details, and I will be on my way. This is a break, not a full-on deletion (because how else will I occasionally use Spotify?). And if they change and improve somehow, I will gladly eat these words.</p>

			 <p>I keep wrestling with when and how to leave Facebook (and actually have a long draft in progress for when I finally do). But where does one go now? What are the other options?</p>
<p>Well, Twitter was my first thought. But I have almost always used third-party clients to access Twitter, and they have been dicks about that lately. In fact, the developers of my favorite Twitter clients (Falcon Pro and Carbon for Android) held a G+ hangout just yesterday to discuss the token limit situation. I hardly ever tweet from the desktop, but even that is better with third-party apps like Tweetbot (I&rsquo;m not counting <a class="zem_slink" title="TweetDeck" href="http://www.tweetdeck.com" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Tweetdeck</a>, which was awesome until Twitter bought it and then totally neglected the Android client).</p>
<p>Google+ is another possible outlet. It manages to have all the features of Facebook (and does a few of them better) without the squicky feeling that they will always step on my <a title="Privacy" href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/18/privacy/">privacy</a>. That is an implicit issue with Google, but that has always been their modus operandi: fantastic services in exchange for advertisement. However, Google+ also feels like an endpoint. It is a place where items I share can end up, but I can&rsquo;t take them and move them elsewhere, like Wordpress.  Twitter and FB suffer from this as well (I haven&rsquo;t investigated Tumblr as much, but I fear the same).</p>
<p>But then <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/02/25/introducing-a-free-tier/">yesterday&rsquo;s App.net news</a> came, and it is starting to sound better and better. Smaller community, great global stream, built-in storage, developer friendly, and user-first. It hits all the right buttons. I may have to give this a try.</p>
<p>There will come a time when we all host our own data and are able to share it however we choose. Until then, I will continue being a <a title="Path" href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/04/path/">social network hipster</a>.</p>

			 <p>I am getting sick of driving. I have to commute for an hour at the beginning and end of each work day. That means, if you don&rsquo;t live on the eastern seaboard or in a major metropolis, a lot of time behind the wheel. I realize there are ways to avoid this. Carpooling is always an option, or I could move or switch jobs. But, because I am lazy and introverted, I tried to imagine other ways to get to work, like public transportation. Northern Indiana is not quite a bastion of public anything, which makes this strictly imaginary. But why is this still imaginary?</p>
<p>Countries in Europe and Asia benefit greatly from high speed rail. According to the NYT (via Gawker), &ldquo;in many countries with good public transportation, <a title="Europeans Hate Cars" href="http://gawker.com/5985394/europeans-hate-cars">driving is a pleasure rather than a necessity</a>.&rdquo; The cynic in me thinks it hasn&rsquo;t caught on here because of our automotive industry (which there is plenty of in north central Indiana). How can they sell cars if there are other viable transport options? Competition should force these car companies to produce better cars, in theory. Of course, it also means change, which is scary.</p>
<p>I was a little bewildered to find out that the idea had been proposed <a title="NYT: Rejection of rail funding" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/us/17rail.html?_r=0">and soundly rejected</a>. This rejection was probably for all the wrong reasons, but I don&rsquo;t want to try to sort out the politics of it. California has recently <a title="CNN: Cal. High Speed rail" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/06/travel/california-high-speed-rail">decided to fund</a> its own high speed rail, after several rejections of its own. So it is catching on somewhere, but it is not catching on fast enough, for all the wrong reasons (as mentioned above).</p>
<p>Monopolies, from the automobile in America (it&rsquo;s a stretch, but not much) down to local cable companies, have a horrible effect on innovation. From a consumer standpoint, they are like an economic cancer to the development of new ideas. However, from a business standpoint (which is pretty much its own religion in this country), profit is your endgame. Building a monopoly should bring on a zen-like state of enlightenment. It is a place where the goals of capitalism fall out of sync with those of the common person, and having the free market try to overthrow a monopoly is a task of Herculean proportions.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this line of thought was <a title="Carriers are the biggest threat to innovation" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/5/3138711/five-years-after-the-iphone-carriers-are-the-biggest-threat-to-innovation-editorial">this Verge piece</a> about wireless carriers. I didn&rsquo;t want to write another post about phones, but it makes a fantastic point. Apple completely reinvented the concept of a phone, and it still was not enough to disrupt the amount of sway US carriers have over device manufacturers.  This would be like, instead of purchasing an SUV to drive on steep mountain roads, the road saying it only accepts Jeep™ vehicles.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I will keep paying exorbitant prices for fuel, and keep passing the SUVs with a single passenger on my 2-lane-highway commute, and think about moving to California.</p>

			 <p>The amount of people that do not (or even choose not to) understand modern technology and the internet is bewildering. I see it day to day at work (my company thinks it is a &ldquo;tech&rdquo; company! Cute) and from the people elected to make laws. I remember a TA in a software engineering course tell us about an internship he had in which he automated all his work in the first couple days using a few <a class="zem_slink" title="Python (programming language)" href="http://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Python</a> scripts. This gave him a free summer to goof around. Menial tasks can generally be avoided these days.</p>
<p>I guess that is why <a title="CISPA" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3984442/cispa-back-in-congress">CISPA</a> bothers me. It seems like a step in the right direction from SOPA, but that step mostly benefits the intermediaries handling user information, not end users themselves. Internet communication is (generally) free speech, and expecting to know who can see your data seems reasonable enough. But the people writing the laws do not see this perspective; they see terrorists and scofflaws (always wanted to use that term) that must be stopped at all costs, and the internet as a readily governable entity. If you can&rsquo;t obtain a warrant for that information, then why do you need it?</p>
<p>The bottom line is just understanding what you are getting into when you are sharing data online. <a title="The Verge - Fighting Dirty" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/13/3984700/microsoft-negative-scroogled-ads-sign-of-things-to-come">Microsoft keeps calling out Google</a> for this, and the only reason it gains any traction is from the personification of Google reading your email. Putting any rational thought into that renders it absurd (how many people would they have to hire to read every Gmail account?). Part of the reason I started this blog, besides having a place for longform thoughts, is that I don&rsquo;t really trust<a title="Path" href="https://pilch.me/2013/02/04/path/"> Facebook</a> with my data that much to begin with. Ever since they went public, they have seemed a little desperate about finding new ways to monetize my data. I would like to use that data to <a title="The New Inquiry - Don't Be A Stranger" href="http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/dont-be-a-stranger/">interact with people</a> instead of with more computers. And if I would like it to be private, it should be private.</p>

			 <p>As an Android user, I am sick of developers picking iOS over Android as their initial mobile launch. It may be that I don&rsquo;t understand the difficulty of porting between OS&rsquo;es, or that about half of Android users are running a nearly 3-year-old version of it. But when something like Vine, which has the engineering power of Twitter behind it, forgoes the majority of the smartphone market by making an iOS-only application, it irks me. Remember, it was only after Instagram released on Android that it sold for $1 billion.</p>
<p>That is why I am starting this list. It is all the applications that I have seen or tried that don&rsquo;t bother to cater to my sector of the market. I will try to update it frequently, as I find out about new ones (and there are always new ones).</p>

			 <p>The pantheon of Things The Internet Does Not Hate is pretty hard to join. Cats, for whatever reason, have always been on this list. Certain entertainment enters and exits over time. Arrested Development (it&rsquo;s coming back!!), for instance. Downton Abbey is another. The most relatable (at least to me) is Community. (And I wish I could say favorite, but, come on, Arrested Development!)</p>
<p>Maybe it isn&rsquo;t actually on the aforementioned list. It could be a product of my own filter bubble, but I see it that way all the same. It deftly fills several sitcom tropes (gang of misfits, will-they-won&rsquo;t-they, school stereotypes) and at the same time deftly undermines them (misfits actually center of attention, &ldquo;will-they-won&rsquo;t-they&rdquo; is actually &ldquo;yeah, they have for a while&rdquo;, the term &ldquo;school&rdquo; is pretty loosely applied to Greendale). The first season of the show nails the vibe of a community college for anyone who has ever attended one. And oh the meta humor. Multiple timelines, homages galore, anus flags. Señor Chang, otherwise known as EL TIGRE CHINO, BECAUSE HIS KNOWLEDGE WILL BITE YOUR FACE OFF.</p>
<p>At its best, Community will tire you with laughter, and make you feel better for being a proverbial outsider.</p>
<p>At worst, it will bridge the yawning gap of midwinter from 30 Rock (RIP) to Arrested Development. (or Venture Brothers! or Game of Thrones! Crap there is a lot of TV to watch) (and a lot of parentheses in this post)</p>

			 <p>Problems with smartphones, as with so many things in life, are seemingly always user error. Nobody has an innate ability to operate such advanced technology unless they were drawn in a comic book or something.

<p>They don&rsquo;t see the potential in their smartphone the way I do. All the things it can do and will soon be able to do. Connections to be made, data to be remembered or shared. It is how I communicate with the world outside my immediate vicinity, and occasionally within it. Smartphones have broken the fourth wall of reality, and the world can never go back to the way things were.</p>

			 <p>Facebook is causing me major hipster backlash. I wasn&rsquo;t there first, but I was damn sure there before they let just anyone use it. It was such a different place when you actually had a Wall, and the big addition was uploading pictures.</p>
<p>It has evolved into a hideous amalgamation of all the things you do on the internet, or at least it is trying to do that. I admit that this is the only way I use it now, but <a title="I'm almost ashamed to still use it" href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/52a20d7a17de" target="_blank">I&rsquo;m almost ashamed to still use it</a>, even in that way. People on Twitter are more interesting and up to date, and people on Google+ are more engaged. Foursquare does its one thing better than everyone else. Tumblr handles memes and things far better, and you can make it your own.</p>
<p>But <a title="Path" href="http://path.com">Path</a> is different. It is what people initially put into their Facebook profile before it spirals out of control. Poignant and personal. No more or less information than you need. Limits on your connections force you to choose who you share with. Its focus on design is so great that Facebook has no problem copying it outright.</p>
<p>I still do not have the courage to drop off of Facebook, but I am close. Shareholders and the new drive to monetize everything I put into it make me wary of putting anything else into it. But I am trying to find a reason past sheer disgust. I want others to share that disgust and subsequently make their own exodus. If they are worth it, I will find them wherever they end up.</p>
<p>Update (2/5): Looks like <a title="I wasn't far off." href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/5/3955410/pew-poll-finds-facebook-users-often-take-breaks" target="_blank">I wasn&rsquo;t far off.</a></p>

			 <p>I am battling with how to write a blog post without dropping into the mundane details of everyday life. It is something we have all become aware of with the rise in social media. There are people that inherently know how to use it, and there are people who do not. It is an ongoing internal struggle for me to grok this. It is probably why I started this blog.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been that guy that puts up 14 pictures of the omelet he just made for breakfast. And that is not just a &ldquo;do unto others&hellip;&rdquo; thing; it mostly stems from the feeling that I don&rsquo;t have much important to say. I don&rsquo;t text friends or family out of the blue, even really good friends. I&rsquo;m good at returning email, but not initiating the conversation.</p>
<p>So, before this post ends up eating itself, get to the point. That is why this blog was started. See if inspiration can be wrung from the person described above. Or, not even inspiration &ndash; just content. Balancing sparse entries with insight. Learning to make fingers type sentence good. Creating.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s quaint that after all those years of having to memorize and change and rememorize passwords, the better option might be an actual key.</p>
<p>It was summed up best in xkcd:<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/936/"><img class="alignnone" alt="xkcd: Password strength" src="https://pilch.micro.blog/uploads/2025/381bd27bda.jpg" width="740" height="601"></a></p></p>
<p>Two factor authentication is finally moving beyond this problem for the average consumer. It is the fancy term for using something you know along with something you have to gain access to online accounts. It is a case of tech finally catching up to a fairly normal part of everyday life. I can see it becoming ubiquitous once <a title="Chrome" href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/18/3890138/google-wants-to-ditch-passwords" target="_blank">Chrome</a> adopts it.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a sci-fi trope (I believe I originally encountered in Animorphs - I&rsquo;m a 90&rsquo;s kid) where the alien civilization invented books long after developing their version of the internet. They can&rsquo;t understand why the internet would be superior, because books offer the same knowledge with instantaneous access. You don&rsquo;t get access to your house by knocking on the door and saying &ldquo;correct horse battery staple&rdquo; for the same reason.</p>

<blockquote>
  If you're outside of the United Kingdom then getting a good live feed of the Olympics isn't easy. NBC is streaming some video, but it's ugly, slow, and requires a cable subscription. Worse, what they're showing on their over-the-air broadcast is tape delayed. In short, NBC is failing to deliver suitable coverage in a connected age. If you don't want the internet (or the morning newspaper, in some cases) to spoil everything, here's how to get access to the official (and excellent) BBC live streams.

<blockquote>
  Continuing last night’s urgent and horrifying news story, in which our own Kyle Ryan asked everyone to stop what they were doing and immediately begin making Anchorman quotes, here a few more details on that Anchorman sequel they said would never happen, just so they could see the look on your face when Will Ferrell announced it was back on. According to Deadline, Adam McKay will once again direct from a script co-written with Ferrell, Judd Apatow will once more produce, and so far Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, and David Koechner are all expected to reprise their roles as the Channel 4 News Team (though Entertainment Weekly is a little less sure about Koechner). It is, indeed, kind of a big deal. Movie quotes!

<blockquote>
  INDIANAPOLIS—Butler's Final Four appearance—its second in as many years—has inspired and energized not only the state of Indiana but thousands of tall, awkward, acne-riddled Midwestern dopes who reportedly see a lot of themselves in the Division I basketball team. "The Bulldogs aren't just a mid-major surprise anymore—they're the real deal," one lanky, bucktoothed 16-year-old goof told reporters Friday. "It just goes to show that you can make something of yourself even if you're gangly, uncoordinated, and mostly made of elbows and knees. With an oversized head. And really droopy eyes. And pasty skin with weird freckles. And no friends." Similarly, in Virginia, the bold, charismatic leadership of VCU's head coach Shaka Smart has inspired two people with the first name Shaka.

<blockquote>
  PITTSBURGH—The Steelers' Rashard Mendenhall has been stranded in a neighboring space-time continuum after particularly solid blocking by guard Ramon Foster and tackle Flozell Adams opened up a massive black hole in the Jets defense, which Mendenhall ran through for a huge interdimensional gain Sunday. "We're particularly concerned about his health due to the gravitic flux that discharges across the black hole's event horizon," said head coach Mike Tomlin, who called a time-out when Mendenhall translated out of our universe and sent the team's medical staff to wait at the edge of the singularity's accretion disc, but to no avail. "All we can do now is wait and hope that the alternate Steelers playing on the O-line in that version of Heinz Field can open up a hole big enough to bring him home." Although NFL rules state that the yardage gained on trans-dimensional plays is considered infinite, any gain by Mendenhall was wiped out by a holding call on center Doug Legursky.

<blockquote>
  INDIANAPOLIS—Indianapolis Colts head coach Jim Caldwell told reporters Thursday he has decided to start 13-year veteran and 11-time Pro Bowler Peyton Manning at quarterback for Saturday's wild-card matchup against the New York Jets. "After much deliberation, we believe that Peyton's four MVP awards and one Super Bowl ring give us the best chance to win," said Caldwell, adding that Manning being a first-ballot Hall of Famer "factored somewhat" into his final decision. "Curtis Painter is a promising young player, but at the end of the day, you have to ask yourself, 'Do I go with the guy who has 28 career pass attempts or with the fastest player in NFL history to reach 1,000 completions, 2,000 completions, 3,000 completions, and 4,000 completions?'" Caldwell concluded the press conference by stressing that it's "always week-to-week," but Manning would likely be the frontrunner to start a divisional matchup should he lead the team to victory Saturday.

<blockquote>
  EDEN PRAIRIE, MN—Though Vikings quarterback Brett Favre confirmed his ailing right shoulder was "no big deal right now" and that the broken bones in his left foot were "uncomfortable but endurable" for the moment, the three-time MVP told reporters Thursday that one more loss could exacerbate his injuries to the point where he would have to retire. "At this level, and at my age, it would take just one game-breaking play—a deep pass, a long run, anything—by the opposing offense to aggravate an injury to the point where I can't go on," said Favre, who later claimed his injuries become more serious with each defeat he suffers. "It's entirely possible for any given team on our schedule to outscore me so badly I can't physically continue my heroic streak of consecutive starts." Favre also added that any victory he led the 3-6 Vikings to this season would be an amazing display of toughness.

<blockquote>
  CHICAGO — Less than 24 hours after a visit from Bears quarterback and Type 1 diabetes sufferer Jay Cutler, a group of 32 schoolchildren who shared his disease died Tuesday. "Their spirits were really high just before Mr. Cutler arrived, but literally the second he entered the room the kids just sort of closed off, and once he started talking about how poorly he was treated in Denver, they became sullen and quiet," said Erin Matthews, who until Tuesday ran a diabetes support group for children ages 8 to 14 at the downtown YMCA. "After I recovered from my shock, I was surprised that all the children died, seeing as diabetes isn't terminal and can be controlled with medication. However, considering how sickened they were by Mr. Cutler, well, it sort of makes sense. That the kids were able to live through the entire talk is a testament to their bravery." Since his professional football career began in 2006, Cutler has killed more than 3,000 disabled or sick children by taking time to speak to them.
